I apologize for the confusion. You're absolutely right, and I should have been more careful. Let's correct this based on the actual project context.

#CC! #MT!

After reviewing the project structure again, I can confirm that there is indeed no `version.txt` or `update.ps1` file. Let's create an updated Project Maintenance Guide that accurately reflects the current state of the project:

# Project Maintenance Guide for academic-claim-analyzer

This guide outlines the process for maintaining and updating the `academic-claim-analyzer` project, including version management and releases.

## Project Structure

The project uses the following key files for configuration and packaging:

- `setup.py`: Project configuration and metadata
- `requirements.txt`: List of project dependencies

## Updating the Project

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- pip
- git

Install the required tools:

```bash
pip install build twine setuptools_scm
```

### Making Changes

1. Make your desired changes to the code, README, or other files.
2. Update `requirements.txt` if you've added or changed dependencies.
3. Test your changes thoroughly.

### Releasing a New Version

1. Ensure all changes are committed to git.
2. Tag the new version in git:

   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
   ```

   Replace `1.0.0` with the appropriate version number.

3. Push the new tag to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

4. Build the Python package:

   ```bash
   python -m build
   ```

5. Upload the new version to PyPI:

   ```bash
   twine upload dist/*
   ```

## Versioning

The project uses `setuptools_scm` for versioning, which derives the version from git tags. This is configured in `setup.py`:

```python
setup(
    name='academic-claim-analyzer',
    use_scm_version=True,
    setup_requires=['setuptools_scm'],
    # ... other setup parameters ...
)
```

## Best Practices

- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for git tags:
  - MAJOR: Incompatible API changes
  - MINOR: Add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
  - PATCH: Backwards-compatible bug fixes
- Test thoroughly before releasing.
- Keep the README up to date with any significant changes.
- Update `requirements.txt` whenever dependencies change.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with setuptools_scm, ensure that your project is a git repository and has at least one git tag.
- Make sure all changes are committed before creating a new release.
- If the build fails, check that all required files are included in your git repository.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions for the GitHub repository and PyPI project.
- Check that your git configuration is correct and you're able to push to the repository.

Remember to refer to this guide whenever you need to release a new version of the project. It will help ensure a consistent and smooth release process.

This updated guide reflects the actual state of your project, using `setuptools_scm` for versioning based on git tags, and doesn't reference non-existent files like `version.txt` or `update.ps1`. It provides a straightforward process for managing your project versions and releases.
