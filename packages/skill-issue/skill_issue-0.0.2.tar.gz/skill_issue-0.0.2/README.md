# Skill Issue

So, finally wanna flex those who doubt you as a developer?
well, here it is, destroy them with this library, and the classic "Import skill issue" line. (This is my joke and I am working on copyrighting it idk)

## Functions

- `print_with_user(str)`: Prints the string with "just had a skill issue" appended.

```python
import skill_issue as si 

si.print_with_user("User")

```

The output should look like

```bash
User just had a skill issue
```

- `skillissue()`: Prints "skill issue".

```python
import skill_issue as si 

si.skillissue()

```

The output should look like

```bash
skill issue
```

- `niw()`: Prints "Nah, I'd win".

```python
import skill_issue as si 

si.niw()

```

The output should look like

```bash
Nah, I'd win
```
