# Piyathon

Piyathon is a language-localized superset of Python that uses Thai keywords and function names. It employs a token-based translation approach to convert between standard Python and Piyathon code. This method allows Piyathon to maintain full compatibility with Python's syntax and features while providing a Thai language interface.

The project includes tools for bidirectional translation between Python and Piyathon, as well as a simple interpreter for directly executing Piyathon code. By leveraging the existing Python interpreter instead of building a new one from scratch, Piyathon offers an efficient solution for Thai speakers to learn and use Python concepts.

This approach makes programming more accessible to Thai speakers, particularly beginners, by reducing language barriers while still allowing them to transition to standard Python seamlessly.

## Installation

Piyathon requires Python 3.12. It can be installed using the following command:

```bash
pip install piyathon
```
