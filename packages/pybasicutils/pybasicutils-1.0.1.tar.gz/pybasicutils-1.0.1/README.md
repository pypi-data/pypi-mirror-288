Hi, I'm ItzSCodez1467 A.K.A. Srijal Dutta. I consider myself an intermediate programmer. In usually work with python for backend and for the frontend which I rarely add to my projects I have made quite a few projects but I don't want to really share them as they are not really that important. I'll keep adding some projects over time.
