# WeatherPy - A python Wrapper for Weather 



WeatherPy is a simple Python module for fetching current weather conditions and future weather forecasts using the WeatherAPI. It abstracts the complexity of dealing with the API and provides straightforward functions for retrieving weather data by just providing the city name.



## Features



- Get current weather information, including temperature, weather condition, and wind speed.

- Fetch a 5-day weather forecast, including daily maximum and minimum temperatures and weather conditions.



## Installation



To install WeatherPy, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Install the required dependency by running:



```bash

pip install Weatherpy-1==0.1

```



## Usage



### Import the Module



Import the functions from the `weatherpy` module to get started.



```python

from WeatherPy.weather_utils import GetWeather, FutureForecast

```



### Get Current Weather



Use the `GetWeather` function to retrieve the current weather for a specific city.



#### Example



```python

from WeatherPy.weather_utils import GetWeather



city = "London"

current_weather = GetWeather(city)



if isinstance(current_weather, dict):

    print(f"Temperature: {current_weather['temprature_c']}°C")

    print(f"Condition: {current_weather['condition']}")

    print(f"Wind Speed: {current_weather['wind']} kph")

else:

    print(current_weather)

```



#### Output



```

Temperature: 15°C

Condition: Partly cloudy

Wind Speed: 12 kph

```



### Get Future Forecast



Use the `FutureForecast` function to get a 5-day weather forecast for a given city.



#### Example



```python

from WeatherPy.weather_utils import FutureForecast



city = "London"

forecast = FutureForecast(city)



if isinstance(forecast, list):

    for day in forecast:

        print(f"Date: {day['date']}")

        print(f"Max Temp: {day['max_temp']}°C")

        print(f"Min Temp: {day['min_temp']}°C")

        print(f"Condition: {day['condition']}")

        print()

else:

    print(forecast)

```



#### Output



```

Date: 2024-08-05

Max Temp: 22°C

Min Temp: 15°C

Condition: Sunny



Date: 2024-08-06

Max Temp: 23°C

Min Temp: 16°C

Condition: Cloudy

```



## API Key Management



WeatherPy handles the API key internally. Users only need to provide the city name as a parameter to the functions.
