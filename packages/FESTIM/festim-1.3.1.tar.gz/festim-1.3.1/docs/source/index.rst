FESTIM
======

FESTIM is a FEniCS-based application for solving coupled hydrogen transport - heat transfer simulations.
The tool is based on the finite element methods to solve the McNabb & Foster transport equations and the heat equation.
It is capable of solving 1D/2D/3D multimaterial simulations and provides support for a wide-range of boundary conditions, which makes it a very versatile tool that can be adapted to many use cases.
Moreover, users can rapidly get started with FESTIM thanks to its python API.

FESTIM was originally developed at the `Institute for Magnetic Fusion Research (IRFM) <https://irfm.cea.fr/en/index.php>`_ and the `Process and Materials Sciences Laboratory (LSPM) <https://www.lspm.cnrs.fr/en/home/>`_.
Various research institutions and private companies now contribute actively to FESTIM's development.
For more information, feel free to ask questions on the `FESTIM Discourse Page <https://festim.discourse.group/>`_.
