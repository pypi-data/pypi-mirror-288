# Oumuamua

---

## Summary
Oumuamua is feature that is supposed to exist on two types of Howl Beacons.   

---

### Howl Beacon 1
Howl Beacon 1 is a Howl Beacon that is connected to the internet.  Possibly there might be an ICANN address or ICANN addresses online where one can interact with a Howl Beacon 1.


### Howl Beacon 2
Howl Beacon 2 is for consenting to moves.

It is a Howl Beacon that should have very limited connected to the internet.
It should interact with QR codes and an camera, or possibly with hexadecimal strings over USB.

That is activities in the "Relatives" portion of the feature are activities that should happen offline.
Those activities are locating addresses and signing transactions.

## Install Oumuamua to Howl Beacon 2, Docker Method

```
1. From Howl Beacon 1, Install the Docker Engine:
```
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

Docker can open an OS within an OS.  

This is 

```
2. From Howl Beacon 1, Install the Docker Ubuntu Image
```
```
docker pull ubuntu
```

```
3. From Howl Beacon 1, Create an Oumuamua Image
```

This creates a docker container from the ubuntu image
and then opens the docker container.
```
docker run -it ubuntu
```

```
apt update
apt install python3-pip -y
apt install python3.12-venv
mkdir /habitat
cd /habitat
python3 -m venv v_env
. v_env/bin/activate
```

```
pip install Oumuamua
echo "essence = {}" > Oumuamua_essence.py
```

```
docker container ls
docker commit 5d1648e48d6c oumuamua:v0.0.1
docker image ls
docker save -o oumuamua_v0.0.1.tar oumuamua:v0.0.1
```


```
4. From Howl Beacon 2, with Internet Connectivity, Install the Docker Engine
```
```
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
```

```
5. From Howl Beacon 2, with Internet Connectivity, 
   Install any other software that you want offline.
```
```
such as:
	IDE: codelite
		https://docs.codelite.org/downloads/download/#ubuntu-debian
		
	gitnuro
```

```
6.	Permanently Disconnect Howl Beacon 2 from the internet.
```
If you do want an upgrade to the "Relatives" Howl Beacon that isn't docker
image, wiping the drive and then creating a fresh OS might be a good plan.

## Glossary
### Howl Beacon
It's like a beacon that can send loud alerts. 

Maybe it has a 3 button physical combination lock on the back,
that unlocks buttons. 

	1 is a loud police alert.
	1 is a silent police alert.  
	1 is a silent ambulance alert. 

Could be synced with a wearable.	
	
	Similar:
		@ Alert Beacon
