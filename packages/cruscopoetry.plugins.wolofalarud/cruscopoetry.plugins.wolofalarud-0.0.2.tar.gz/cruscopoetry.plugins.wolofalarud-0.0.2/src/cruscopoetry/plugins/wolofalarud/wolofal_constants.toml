## - index: an integer which must be different for any element of the same type (es. for any metre, foot, etc.) They are not required to be progressive, therefore specify them instead on relying 
##          on the element's position in the array

##	- forms: an array of integers representing the forms a metre can have (tāmm, maǧzūʾ, etc.)

##besides the base fields, a metre form must also contain:
## - aruuds_number: an integer which specifies how many ʿarūḍs the metre has. So, for example, in tāmm forms this number is 1, since we have two hemistichs in total (1 ʿarūḍ + 1 ḍarb);
##	 in mašṭūr forms it is 0, since the line has only the ḍarb; in tarbīʿa it is 3 (4 cola: 3 ʿarūḍs + 1 ḍarb); etc.
## - transform: an integer representing the transformation the line must undergo. If it is 0, nothing changes (this is actually the case for most of the forms); if it is 1, ǧazʾ is applied; 
##	 if it is 2, nahk is applied.

## zihāfāt contain, besides the basis requirements, two other fields: conditions and transform. 
##	- condition is an array of requirements that the foot must satisfy in order to be affected by the ziḥāfa. Each requirement has the following syntax: 'i -> <h>', where i is an integer indicating 
##	  the i-th letter of the foot and h is a ḥarf value (0 or 1). If foot contains less than i letters, the requirement will automatically be considered as not satisfy.
##	  It is possible also to indicate that the harf at a certain index must NOT match a certain harf value using the marker !->. Therefore: 1 !-> 0 means that the second letter of the foot must
##	  not be vocalized.
##  - transform is an array of transformations that are applied in the order they are placed to a foot, if all the requirements in condition have been satisfied (order matters! dropping a letter
##	  changes the index position of the others, therefore pay attention in ziḥāfāt muzdawiǧa to transform first the letter with a higher index!). There are two possible transformations:
##	   + 'drop i': drops the ḥarf at index i
##	   + 'silence i': silences the ḥarf at index i.

## ʿilal contain, besides the base values, also a boolean value that says if they can occur in ḥašw, the conditions of their applicability and the way they transform the foot.
## - the field `in_hashw` stores a boolean value: it is true if the ʿilla can occur within the ḥašw
## - the field `conditions` is an array of requirements. A foot on which the ʿilla must be applied should first satisfy all these requirements.
##	 each requirement that any ʿilla must satisfy can be rendered with strings having this syntax: "i -> type_of_epu". In this expression, i is the epu that is at index i in the foot
##	 (as for python lists and tuples, i can be also negative, and thus indicating an index counting from the last element). type_of_epu is the kind of EPU that should be
##	 found at index , and is represented by a sequence of ḥarf values represented by 0 and 1: therefore, sabab ḫafīf is 01, sabab ṯaqīl is 00, etc.
##	 one could also put as requirement that the EPU at index it should NOT match a certain type: in this case, one would write "i !-> type_of_epu", with an exclamation mark before the 
##	 association symbol.
##
## - the field `transform` is an array of transformations. If an ʿilla is applicable to a foot, this will undergo all the transformations in the order they are inserted into this array.
##   all the transformations can be reduced to these types:
##    + appending an EPU at the foot's end: the syntax 'put <epu>', where <epu> is the sequence of ḥarf values representing the EPU. For example, put 01 appends a sabab ḫāfīf
##	  + appending a ḥarf: the syntax is 'put <h>', where <h> is 0 or 1. The program must recognize that a ḥarf is not an epu, and that therefore it must be appended to the last foot of the epu 
##		rather than be added as new epu.
##	  + dropping an EPU at a given position: syntax 'pop i'.
##	  + substituting the first occurrence of a certain kind of epu with another: syntax '<epu> -> <new_epu>'. For example, '001 -> 01' will find the watid maǧmūʿ of a foot and substitute it with a
##      sabab ḫafīf
