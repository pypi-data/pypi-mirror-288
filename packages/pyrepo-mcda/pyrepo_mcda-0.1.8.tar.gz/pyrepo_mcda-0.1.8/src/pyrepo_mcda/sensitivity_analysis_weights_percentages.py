        """
        Method for sensitivity analysis. This method determines rankings of alternatives using chosen
        MCDA method name `mcda_name` for different modifications of criterion `j` weight.

        Parameters
        -----------
            matrix : ndarray
                Decision matrix with alternatives performances data. This matrix includes
                values of alternatives performances in rows considering criteria in columns

            weights : ndarray
                Vector with criteria weights. All weights in this vector must sum to 1.

            types : ndarray
                Vector with criteria types. Types can be equal to 1 for profit criteria and -1
                for cost criteria.

            percentages : ndarray
                Vector with percentage values of given criteria weight modification in range from 0 to 1.

            method : class
                Initialized object of class of chosen MCDA method

            j : int
                Index of column in decision matrix `matrix` that indicates for which criterion
                the weight is modified.

            dir_list : list
                list with directions (signs of value) of criterion weight modification. 1 denotes increasing,
                and -1 denotes decreasing weight value. You can provide [-1, 1] for increasing and
                decreasing, [-1] for only decreasing, or [1] for only increasing chosen criterion weight.

        Returns
        --------
            data_sens : DataFrame
                dataframe with rankings calculated for subsequent modifications of criterion j weight
