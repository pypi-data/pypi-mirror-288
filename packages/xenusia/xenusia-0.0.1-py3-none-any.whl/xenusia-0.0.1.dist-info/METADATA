## About Xenusia

Xenusia is a Ppredictor of DNA-binding proteins in archaea. 

If you use Xenusia in your research, please consider citing:


## Installation

Package installation should only take a few minutes with any of these methods (pip, source).

### Installing Xenusia with pip:

We suggest to create a local conda environment where to install xenusia. it can be done with:

```sh
conda create -n xenusia
```
and activated with

```sh
conda activate xenusia
```

or

```sh
source activate xenusia
```

We also suggest to install pytorch separately following the instructions from https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

```sh
pip install xenusia
```

The procedure will install xenusia in your computer.

### Installing Xenusia from source:

If you want to install Xenusia from this repository, you need to install the dependencies first.
First, install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) separately following the instructions from https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/.

Then install the other required libraries:

```sh
pip install "numpy scikit-learn requests
```

Finally, you can clone the repository with the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/grogdrinker/xenusia/
```

## Usage

the pip installation will install a script called xenusia_standalone that is directly usable from command line (at least on linux and mac. Most probably on windows as well if you use a conda environemnt).

### Using the standalone
The script can take a fasta file or a sequence as input and provide a prediction as output

```sh
xenusia_standalone AWESAMEPRTEINSEQENCEASINPT
```

or, for multiple sequences, do

```sh
xenusia_standalone fastaFile.fasta
```

To write the output in a file, do

```sh
xenusia_standalone fastaFile.fasta -o outputFilePath
```

### Using Xenusia into a python script

Xenusia can be imported as a python module

```python
from xenusia.run_prediction import predict
proteinSeq1 = "ASDASDASDASDASDASDDDDASD"
proteinSeq2 = "ASDADDDDDDDDDDDDDASDASDDDDASD"
proteinSeq2 = "ASDADFFFFFFFFFDDDDDDDDFFFFFFFFFASD"
inputSequences = {"ID1":proteinSeq1,"ID2":proteinSeq2,"ID3":proteinSeq3}

xenusia_output = predict(inputSequences) # which is a dict containig the predictions

```
