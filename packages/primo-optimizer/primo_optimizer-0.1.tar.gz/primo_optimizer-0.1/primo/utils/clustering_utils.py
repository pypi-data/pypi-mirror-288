def distance_matrix(candidates: pd.DataFrame, weights: dict) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Generate a distance matrix based on the given features and associated weights for each
    pair of the given well candidates.

    Parameters
    ----------
    candidates : pd.DataFrame
        Input DataFrame with "Latitude," "Longitude," "Age [Years],"
        and "Depth [ft]" columns of the well candidates.

    weights : dict
        Weights assigned to the features---distance, age, and depth when performing the clustering.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        Distance matrix to be used for the agglomerative clustering method

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        1. If the latitude, longitude, age, or depth is missing in the input DataFrame;
        2. if the sum of feature weights does not equal 1;
        3. if the weight of any feature---distance, age, or depth---is not provided;
        4. if a spurious feature's weight is included apart from the distance, age, and depth.
