class TorchSnapshotSaver(BaseCheckpointer):
    """
    A callback which periodically saves the application state during training using `TorchSnapshot <https://pytorch.org/torchsnapshot/>`_.

    This callback supplements the application state provided by :class:`torchtnt.unit.AppStateMixin`
    with the train progress, train dataloader (if applicable), and random number generator state.

    If used with :func:`torchtnt.framework.fit`, this class will also save the evaluation progress state.

    Checkpoints will be saved under ``dirpath/epoch_{epoch}_step_{step}`` where step is the *total* number of training and evaluation steps completed across all epochs.

    Args:
        dirpath: Parent directory to save snapshots to.
        save_every_n_train_steps: Frequency of steps with which to save snapshots during the train epoch. If None, no intra-epoch snapshots are generated.
        save_every_n_epochs: Frequency of epochs with which to save snapshots during training. If None, no end-of-epoch snapshots are generated.
        save_every_n_eval_epochs: Frequency of evaluation epochs with which to save checkpoints during training. Use this if wanting to save checkpoints after every eval epoch during fit.
        keep_last_n_checkpoints: Number of most recent checkpoints to keep. If None, all checkpoints are kept. If an excess of existing checkpoints are present, the oldest ones will be deleted to clean the difference. If best checkpoint config is enabled, this param will manage the top n checkpoints instead.
        best_checkpoint_config: Configuration for saving the best checkpoint based on a monitored metric. The metric is read off the attribute of the unit prior to checkpoint.
        process_group: The process group on which the ranks will communicate on. default: ``None`` (the entire world)
        async_checkpoint: Whether to perform asynchronous snapshotting. Default: ``True``.
        replicated: A glob-pattern of replicated key names that indicate which application state entries have the same state across all processes.
            For more information, see https://pytorch.org/torchsnapshot/main/api_reference.html#torchsnapshot.Snapshot.take.

            .. warning:: The replication property is safer to not set, and should only be used if really needed.
                         Things like metrics, grad_scalers, etc should not be marked as replicated as they
                         may contain different values across processes. If unsure, leave this field unset.

        storage_options: Additional keyword options for the storage plugin to use, to be passed to `torchsnapshot.Snapshot <https://pytorch.org/torchsnapshot/stable/api_reference.html#torchsnapshot.Snapshot>`_.
            See each storage plugin's documentation for customizations.
        knob_options: Additional keyword options for the snapshot knobs

    Note:
        If torch.distributed is available and default process group is initialized, the constructor will call a collective operation for rank 0 to broadcast the dirpath to all other ranks

    Note:
        If checkpointing FSDP model, you can set state_dict type calling `set_state_dict_type <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fsdp.html#torch.distributed.fsdp.FullyShardedDataParallel.set_state_dict_type>`_ prior to starting training.

    Note:
        If best_checkpoint_config is enabled, the attribute must be on the unit upon checkpoint time, and must be castable to "float". This value must be maintained by the unit, and updated
        appropriately. For example, if logging validation accuracy, the unit must be responsible for maintaining the value and resetting it when the epoch ends.
