## Whistling Duck

Whistling Duck is a Python library for data quality exploration and validation, designed for small to medium-sized datasets. It is written using DuckDB.

### Why Whistling Duck?

1. Handles datasets larger than available RAM efficiently with DuckDB.
2. All quality checks are implemented in DuckDB SQL for speed.
3. Minimal dependencies: requires DuckDB & Pydantic.
4. No additional infrastructure needed; can be installed like any standard Python library.
5. APIs are designed to be similar to Python Pandas, reducing the learning curve.

## Installation

```
pip install whistlingduck
```

### Contribution 

Goal is to develop a Python library for data quality exploration and validation, for small to medium-sized datasets. The library will exclusively utilize DuckDB, ensuring no external dependencies, and maintain syntax similar to Pandas, given its common usage and familiarity among users. Contributions are welcome from anyone interested in enhancing the library.
