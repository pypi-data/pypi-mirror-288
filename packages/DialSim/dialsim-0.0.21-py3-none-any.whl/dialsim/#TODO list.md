#TODO list
1. Currently Agent uses hard-coded prompt directory for the prompts. Namely, it relies on the files specified on `DialSim` class. This needs to be resolved.
- Maybe upload the predefined .txt files to pypi? And save it in a folder named `prompts`.
2. The exception handling in `load_data` in `DialSim` class is not good. This needs to be resolved.
