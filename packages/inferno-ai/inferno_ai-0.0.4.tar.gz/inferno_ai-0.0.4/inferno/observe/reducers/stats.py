            s_{t + 1} &= \alpha x_{t + 1}  + (1 - \alpha) s_t

    For the smoothed data (state) :math:`s` and observation :math:`x` and
    where smoothing factor :math:`\alpha` is as follows.

    .. math::
        \alpha = 1 - \exp \left(\frac{-\Delta t}{\tau}\right)

    For some time constant :math:`\tau`.

    Args:
        step_time (float): length of time between observations, :math:`\Delta t`.
        alpha (float): exponential smoothing factor, :math:`\alpha`.
        duration (float, optional): length of time over which results should be
            stored, in the same units as :math:`\Delta t`. Defaults to ``0.0.``
        inclusive (bool): if the duration should be inclusive. Defaults to ``False``.
        inplace (bool, optional): if write operations should be performed
            in-place. Defaults to ``False``.
    Note:
        ``alpha`` is decoupled from the step time, so if the step time changes, then the
            underlying time constant will change, ``alpha`` will remain the same.
