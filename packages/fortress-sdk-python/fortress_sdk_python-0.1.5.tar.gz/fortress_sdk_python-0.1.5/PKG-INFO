# Initialize the client with your API key
client = FortressClient(org_id='your_org_id', api_key='your_api_key')

# Connect to a database
conn = client.connect(database_name='your_database_name')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute a query
cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM your_table_name')

# Fetch the results
results = cursor.fetchall()

# Print the results
for row in results:
    print(row)

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```
