# Test Data and Reproduction of Results

In the `test` folder of the `pySymStat` repository, we provide the dataset and expected results for our simulation experiments. Interested researchers can utilize this data to reproduce the results presented in Section 4.1 of our paper.

Please note that the contents of the `test` folder are not included in the PyPI release version of `pySymStat`. Users are required to clone the repository into their local directory using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/mxhulab/pySymStat.git
```
Alternatively, users can download the Release source code file and extract it.

To rerun the test, navigate to the `test` directory and extract the `data.zip` file into a folder named `data`. Then, execute the `run.sh` script with the following command:
```
cd test
unzip data.zip -d data
bash run.sh
```
Please note that the entire testing process may take a considerable amount of time to complete. We have provided all intermediate results in the `data.zip` file. If you only wish to view the summary result, you can run the `summary.py` script using the following command:
```
python summary.py
```
This will print a summary of all the tests as follows:
