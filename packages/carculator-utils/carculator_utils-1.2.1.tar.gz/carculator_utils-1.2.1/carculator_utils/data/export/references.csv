J Ind Ecol. 2022; 26: 964– 979. https://doi.org/10.1111/jiec.13234. Coal is a common precursor for the tar pitch which is used for the preparation of graphitization precursor and also for coating of the final spherical graphite. Relevant data include coal mining, coking to produce tar and distillation of tar to produce pitch. It is understood that the distillation of tar to pitch is generally integrated with the coal coking, and the authors were not able to identify a reputable source containing dedicated dataset for distillation. Allocation is based on physical yield of tar pitch.;;transport;Road\Vehicle components\Energy storage\Lithium-ion battery
