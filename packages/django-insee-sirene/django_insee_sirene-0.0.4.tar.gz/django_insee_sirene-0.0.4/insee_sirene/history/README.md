This folder and its content aims to keep a track of the last automatic models generation from the `generate_insee_sirene_models` command.

The [raw_generated_models.py](raw_generated_models.py) file must contains the content of the result of the `generate_insee_sirene_models` command with no changes (no formatting, etc) to allow to easily identify the changes made between two versions of the sources files.
