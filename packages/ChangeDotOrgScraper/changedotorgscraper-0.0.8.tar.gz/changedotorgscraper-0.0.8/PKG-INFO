## Installation
To install in python, simply do the following: 
```bash
pip install ChangeDotOrgScraper
```

## Quick Start
Here we provide a quick example on how you can use `ChangeDotOrgScraper` to scrape petition data right from [change.org](https://www.change.org/). 

```python
from ChangeDotOrgScraper import scrape_petitions

# Specify the url of your scrape.org searches
## for instance, we shall scrape petitions from the search "supplemental nutrition assistance program"
url='https://www.change.org/search?q=Supplemental%20Nutrition%20Assistance%20Program&offset=0'

# scrape the petition data from change.org
SNAP_petitions_df=scrape_petitions(url)
print(SNAP_petitions_df)
```
It returns a dataframe with all the petitions data, which contains details such as the petition(s) title, description, date created, target audience signature count, location created, victory status, etc. 



## Requirements
### Required packages
