# Introduction 
Welcome! This abstract library contains base classes for PRISM. 
Below is a guide for getting everything up and running on your system. To begin, ensure that Poetry is 
installed and up to date on your machine. 

## Adding to a project
To pull the library into a project, cd to the relevant project from the command line and enter the command 
```poetry add prism_abstract_library```.

## Contributing
All interaction with this module should be done through a virtual environment. If your project doesn't 
automatically start in the Poetry shell, run the command```poetry shell```. Once Poetry is installed, 
up to date, and you're in the virtual environment, run ```poetry install``` to nab the dependencies.
