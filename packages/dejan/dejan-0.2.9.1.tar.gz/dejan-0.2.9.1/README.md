### Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```bash

```

### Current Utilities

#### roo

**Purpose:** Fetches and processes data from the Algoroo API, providing insights into search engine fluctuations.

**Search Engine Options:**

* 2: Google.com (Desktop)
* 3: Google.com.au (Desktop)
* 4: Google.com (Mobile)
* 5: Google.com.au (Mobile)

**Output:** The data can be returned either as a raw JSON object or as a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

**Example Usage:**

```python
from dejan import roo

def main():
    # Mapping of search engines to their corresponding identifiers
    search_engines = {
        2: "google.com/desktop",
        3: "google.com.au/desktop",
        4: "google.com/mobile",
        5: "google.com.au/mobile"
    }
    
    # Choose the search engine by setting the appropriate identifier
    search_engine = 2  # Change this number to select a different search engine:
                       # 2: google.com/desktop
                       # 3: google.com.au/desktop
                       # 4: google.com/mobile
                       # 5: google.com.au/mobile
    
    # Fetch data as a pandas DataFrame
    roo_data = roo.get_roo(search_engine, as_dataframe=True)
    
    # Display the first few rows of the DataFrame
    print(f"Data for search engine {search_engine} ({search_engines[search_engine]}):")
    print(roo_data.head())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

#### linkbert

**Purpose:** Uses the LinkBERT model to predict link tokens in the provided text, useful for analyzing link placement within content.

**Grouping Modes:**

* `subtoken`: Returns individual subword tokens classified as links.
* `token`: Merges any subtokens into whole tokens (words).
* `phrase`: Groups predictions into phrases, treating the entire phrase as a link if any part of it is classified as a link.

**Example Usage:**

```python
from dejan import linkbert

def main():
    # Initialize the LinkBERTInference model
    model = linkbert.LinkBERTInference()

    # Sample text for prediction
    text = "LinkBERT is a model developed by Dejan Marketing designed to predict natural link placement within web content."

    print("Input Text:")
    print(text)
    print("-" * 50)

    # Group by subtoken
    links_subtoken = model.predict_link_tokens(text, group="subtoken")
    print(f"Predicted link tokens (subtoken): {links_subtoken}")

    # Group by token
    links_token = model.predict_link_tokens(text, group="token")
    print(f"Predicted link tokens (token): {links_token}")

    # Group by phrase
    links_phrase = model.predict_link_tokens(text, group="phrase")
    print(f"Predicted link tokens (phrase): {links_phrase}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### dirtree

**Purpose:** Generates an ASCII representation of the directory tree structure from any given root directory, including all subdirectories and files.

**Usage:** This tool can be particularly useful for visualizing file structures in complex projects, making it easier to manage and navigate large SEO datasets.

**Example Usage:**

```python
from dejan import generate_ascii_tree

# Generate and print the directory tree for the current directory
generate_ascii_tree()
```
