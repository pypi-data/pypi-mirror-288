Description: 
        # git show bigfiles - detection of files by size
        
        The tool allows to check for large files in a git repo
        with the intent to put it under git-lfs control.
        
        Specifically it will check for parts being changed often.
        
        The tool requires "git" to be installed using "git rev-list" 
        and "git cat-file" to inspect the object store. Read more about
