Generate .gitignore file without leaving the terminal.

Ignori was built with [Textual](https://github.com/textualize/textual)

## Why?

Normally, when I start a project from scratch or the project initialiser does not generate a gitignore file, I have to search for it. With this, the workflow will not be interrupted by having to google it.
