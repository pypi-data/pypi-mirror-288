# Automated Rhythm Generation

ARG: Automated Rhythm Generation.

Let's generate rhythm game maps automatically!

## Neural Networks

- RhythmGen: Generate rhythm sequence from music piece.
  - [x] RGGRU: RhythmGen with CNN feature extractor and GRU.
  - [x] RGGRUAT: RhythmGen with CNN feature extractor, GRU, and multi-head attention.
  - [x] RGTR: RhythmGen with Transformer.
  - [ ] Others: RhythmGen with other architectures.
- RhythmRec: Reconstruct music piece from rhythm sequence.
  - [ ] No, we didn't implement this.
