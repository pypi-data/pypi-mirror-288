# Xanthus

Xanthus is a tool for managing your X (formerly Twitter) feed.

## Usage

### Gather Tweets

```bash
$ xanthus --bookmarks https://x.com/i/bookmarks/1820335919360270491

This will output the list of tweets from this week at `weekly_updates_YYYY-MM-DD.json`
```

### Generate Thread

```text
I will give you the list of weekly updates on Twitter in a JSON format. The primary focus of my account is in the AI domain. Your goal is to provide me the content for a Weekly Update Summary Thread based on the data.

Data (see attached):

Format: 

* You will write multiple tweets forming a thread based on the posts above such that the most 
important announcement comes on the top
* First post will be a generic announcement posts e.g. "Big updates from X, Y and Z in the A, B, 
C categories. Here's what you need to know:"
* You should then output a list of tweets in a twitter thread. Each tweet should summarize an 
important update and then provide the link of the relevant tweet e.,g. "Avi just unveiled Friend, an AI wearable designed to combat loneliness by providing constant companionship https://x.com/AviSchiffmann/status/1818284595902922884"
* You should use the last week as a call to action e.g. "Follow @zeffmuks for more updates in X, Y, Z"
```
