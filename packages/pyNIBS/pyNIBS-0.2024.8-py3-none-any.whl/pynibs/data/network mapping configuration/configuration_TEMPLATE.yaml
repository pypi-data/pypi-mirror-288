# This configuration file contains settings and parameters for the application of the network detection algorithm.

# BINARIZATION
# binarization threshold is calculated as follows: method(response) * bin_factor
bin_method: 'mean'           # mean, median or slope
bin_factor: 1.0

# SCORING
scoring_method: 'clf'         # dual network expected: 'clf' or 'regression', single hotspot expected: 'regress_data' or 'mi'
scoring_emag_thr: 0           # elements with `max(e_mag) > scoring_emag_thr` are scored
scoring_interval: 22          # subsampling resolution: `1/scoring_interval' of all elements are scored

# DETECTION
acc_thr: 0.70                  # accuracy threshold for hotspot elements (lower bound)
corr_thr: 0.5                 # correlation(hot0, hot1) threshold for hotspot pairs (upper bound)

# ADDITIONAL INFO
note: 'MI_score mapping reasons'     # arbitrary string    # NO COMMAS
fn_flag: 'testrun_11'              # mentioned in the file name
subject_id: '35357.53'          #'09440.22' # '13061.30' 35334.2b
response_spec: 'FDI'            # specification (if any) to retrieve the response
efield_spec: 'E_mag'            # E_mag, E_tan, E_norm

save_files: True                # whether to save experimental data & hotspot score data as hdf5
write_effect_map: True          # whether to create effect map which can be used during validation
fn_results: 'evaluation_template'             # file name of the .csv to save the results in

# EFFECT
# parameters used to create effect map - depends on e-field data and does not influence mapping result
effect_full: 42             # at what e-field magnitude the desired effect is expected to manifest fully
effect_saturation: 70       # at what e-mag the desired effect should saturate

# PLOTTING of the found data (not in evaluation sheet)
plot_std: True                # plot e-mag hotspot0 x emag hotspot1 x response
plot_bin: True                # plot e-mag hotspot0 x emag hotspot1 x binarized response
plot_curves: True             # plot e-mag hotspot0 x response and e-mag hotspot1 x response
