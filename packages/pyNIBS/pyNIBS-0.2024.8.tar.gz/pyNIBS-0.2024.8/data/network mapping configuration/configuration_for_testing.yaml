# This configuration file contains settings and parameters for the testing of the network detection algorithm
# by generating response data and then test the algorithm on it.

# ARTIFICIAL DATA GENERATION
hotspot_elm0: 8797            # hotspot element 0
hotspot_elm1: 5334            # hotspot element 1
sample_size: 300              # number of data manifestations (i.e. trials / coil configurations / ...)
rn_seed: 44               # random seed used in multiple places
distribution_type: 'normal'   # 'normal', 'logistic' are implemented
network_type: 'SH_0'           # \in ['NO', 'AND', '1_INH_0', 'SH_0', '0_INH_1', 'SH_1', 'XOR', 'OR']
effect_full: 0.9              # at what e-field magnitude the desired effect is expected to manifest fully
effect_saturation: 1.2       # effect \in [0, effect_upper_bound) (at what e-mag the desired effect should saturate)
jitter_ratio: 0.05            # percentage of data that gets assigned random response values within observed range
jitter_scale: 0.2             # gets multiplied with the mean value to calculate distribution deviation:
                              ##   scale = loc * jitter_scale (smaller -> less noise)

# BINARIZATION
# binarization threshold is calculated as follows: method(response) * bin_factor
bin_method: 'mean'
bin_factor: 1.0

# SCORING
scoring_method: 'clf'         # dual network expected: 'clf' or 'regression', single hotspot expected: 'regress_data' or 'mi'
scoring_emag_thr: 0           # elements with max(e_mag) > scoring_emag_thr are scored
scoring_interval: 22          # subsampling resolution: `1/scoring_interval' of all elements are scored

# DETECTION
acc_thr: 0.70                  # accuracy threshold for hotspot elements (lower bound)
corr_thr: 0.75                 # correlation(hot0, hot1) threshold for hotspot pairs (upper bound)
