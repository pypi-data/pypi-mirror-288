
Filtering Functionalities in FlexEstimator
---------------------------------------------------

In the following, filtering procedures in venco.py for individual profiles are documented. Filtering occurs after the completion of the main
calculation steps using selectors. These are calculated based only on the four flow-related profiles (consumption, plugPower, uncontrolled_charging
and auxilliaryFuelConsumption) in `calcProfileSelectors()` and applied to both flow-profiles and state-profiles.

Four criteria are applied to select individual profiles that are eligible for load shifting.

1.  Profiles that depend on auxilliary fuel are excluded. These are profiles where consumption is higher than available battery SOC for at least one
    hour. This can also occur when vehicles drive only short distances but don't connect to the grid sufficiently.

2.  A minimum daily mileage in km can be set in the non-profile data (per default VencoPy_scalarInput.xlsx) to filter out profiles where the mileage
    is below a specified threshold. In the shipped file, this value is set to 0.

3.  In case a fully charged battery does not suffice for the daily mileage of the respective profile, this profiles is excluded.

4.  Available charging throughout the day doesn't supply sufficient energy for the driven distance. This may occur even though the profile is eligible
    from criteria 3 e.g. when connection is never possible.
