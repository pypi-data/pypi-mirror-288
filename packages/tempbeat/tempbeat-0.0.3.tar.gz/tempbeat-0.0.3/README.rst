    Template-based interbeat interval extraction


Introduction
============
This is a Python package for extracting interbeat intervals from various heartbeat signals. It includes a template-based method developed for in-ear heartbeat sounds, which has also been tested for electrocardiography and photoplethysmography signals. The tests on in-ear heartbeat sounds are described in the following paper:

    Benesch, D., Chabot, P., Tom, A., Voix, J., & Bouserhal, R. E. (2024). Template-based Extraction of Interbeat Intervals from In-Ear Heartbeat Sounds. IEEE International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks (BSN 2024).


Usage
==========
.. code-block:: python

    from tempbeat.extraction.heartbeat_extraction import hb_extract
    # sig is a 1D numpy array
    # peak_time is a 1D numpy array with the time of each heartbeat in seconds
    peak_time = hb_extract(sig, sampling_rate=sampling_rate, method="temp")

To use a method implemented in MATLAB, you need to have MATLAB installed and
`the MATLAB engine for Python`_. After putting the MATLAB code in the
``src/matlab`` folder, you can use it as follows:

.. _the MATLAB engine for Python: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab-engine-for-python.html


.. code-block:: python

    peak_time = hb_extract(sig, sampling_rate=sampling_rate, method="matlab")

Making Changes & Contributing
=============================

This project uses `pre-commit`_, please make sure to install it before making any
changes::

    pip install pre-commit
    cd tempbeat
    pre-commit install

It is a good idea to update the hooks to the latest version::

    pre-commit autoupdate
