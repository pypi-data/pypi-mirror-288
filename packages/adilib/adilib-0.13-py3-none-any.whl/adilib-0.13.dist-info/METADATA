This repository contains a library, `adilib`, that comprises a partial implementation of a data-oriented software design pattern that may be called the *Application Data Interface*.

Note that Python package `setuptools>=63` is required.

### Build the package

```sh
make package
```

### Release the package to a private Python package index

Define environment variables `adiframework_username` and `adiframework_hostname`, or supply these on the command line call below using prepending.

Make sure the host has granted this user SSH upload access to `/home/<username>/private_pypi/pypi`, so that your `.ssh` contains credentials that the host accepts for the given user.

Then use:

```sh
make release-package
```

The output:
```txt

Trying credentials for <username>@adiframework.com ... 
Credentials are valid.

```

### Install the package

Assuming the package index server is setup at `adiframework.com/pypi`, create file `~/.pip/pip.conf`:

```
[global]
extra-index-url = https://adiframework.com/pypi
trusted-host = adiframework.com
```

Also create file `~/.netrc`:

```txt
machine adiframework.com
login <username>
password <password>
```

Then use `pip` in the normal way:

```sh
python -m pip install adilib
```

Check it was installed:
```sh
python -m pip freeze | grep adilib

...

adilib==0.3
```
