## ‚ö†Ô∏è Early Beta Release Notice

**Important:** Labelsmith is currently in its early beta stage (v0.0.1b2). While core functionality is implemented and the software is usable, it is important to note:

- The project currently lacks a comprehensive test suite.
- It may contain bugs and is subject to significant changes.
- The API may undergo changes as we refine the project.

We welcome early adopters and greatly appreciate your feedback, but please use caution when implementing in production environments.

## Project Description

**Labelsmith** is an open-source Python project designed to streamline data annotators' workflows. Our goal is to create a robust, extensible toolkit that empowers data annotators to maximize their productivity, accuracy, and job satisfaction while contributing to the advancement of AI and machine learning projects.

Labelsmith is a project of LabelSTREAM (Label Syndicate for Transparency, Responsibility, and Ethicality in Algorithmic Management), an organization committed to improving the landscape of data annotation and algorithmic management.

### Current Features

The `labelsmith` package currently offers the following core modules:

1. **`shyft`**: A comprehensive shift-logging application built on the `tkinter` GUI framework. Key features include:
   
   - Automatic shift duration tracking with a configurable, always-on-top timer
   - Task metadata recording and note-taking interface
   - Local data persistence for shift entries and tasking history
   - Full CRUD operations for shift records
   - Autologger functionality for streamlined task logging

2. **`utils`**: A collection of utility scripts aimed at optimizing annotator workflows:
   - `utils.income`: Includes the `simulate` function for modeling earnings scenarios based on various workload parameters
   - `utils.metrics`: Provides productivity and earnings analysis tools

## Installation

```bash
pip install labelsmith
```

Please note that this is an early beta release. We strongly recommend installing in a virtual environment for testing purposes.

## Roadmap

1. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Implement comprehensive test suite**
2. Increase code coverage to 80%
3. Develop plugin system for custom annotator tools
4. Expand and improve core functionality of the `shyft` module
5. Enhance the `utils.metrics` module with more advanced analytics
6. Create comprehensive documentation and API reference
