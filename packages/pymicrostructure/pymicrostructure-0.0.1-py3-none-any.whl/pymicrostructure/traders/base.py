class Trader:
    """
    Represents a trader in a financial market.

    This class serves as a base class for specific trader implementations. It provides
    the basic structure for managing orders, trades, and interactions with the market.

    Attributes:
    -----------
    market : Market
        The market instance in which the trader participates.
    orders : list
        A list of orders submitted by the trader.
    filled_trades : list
        A list of trades that have been executed for the trader.
    position : int or float
        The current position of the trader in the market.
    include_in_results : bool
        Flag indicating whether to include this trader in result calculations.
    trader_id : int
        A unique identifier for the trader within the market.

    Methods:
    --------
    cancel_orders(side)
        Cancel active or partially filled orders on a specific side.
    cancel_all_orders()
        Cancel all active or partially filled orders.
    submit_order()
        A method to be implemented by subclasses for submitting orders to the market.
