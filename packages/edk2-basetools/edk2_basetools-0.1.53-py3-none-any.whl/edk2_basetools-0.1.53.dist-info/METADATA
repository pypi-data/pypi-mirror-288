# Tianocore Edk2 Python BaseTools (edk2basetools)

This is a Tianocore maintained project consisting of a the python source files that make up EDK2 basetools. This package's intent is to provide an easy way to organize and share python code to facilitate reuse across environments, tools, and scripts.  Inclusion of this package and dependency management is best managed using Pip/Pypi.

## Current Release

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/edk2_basetools.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/edk2-basetools/)

A minor release occurs for each merged Pull Request, which can be tracked via [commits](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-basetools/commits/master) or [closed pull requests](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-basetools/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed).

## Content

The package contains all python source files necessary to build an EDK2 project. This is a fundamental package and is required for edk2 builds. These tools are typically called by the build system, however each is independently callable.

Examples:

* Build.py
* Split.py
* Trim.py
* AmlToC.py

## Usage

NOTE: It is strongly recommended that you use python virtual environments.  Virtual environments avoid changing the global python workspace and causing conflicting dependencies.  Virtual environments are lightweight and easy to use.  [Learn more](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

* To install run `pip install --upgrade edk2-basetools`
* To use in your python code

### Building with edk2-pytool-extensions

To perform a build using [edk2-pytool-extensions](https://pypi.org/project/edk2-pytool-extensions/) invocables, add the *pipbuild-win* or *pipbuild-unix* scope to the platform build file.

### Building with edk2

Follow the normal build process; it will automatically detect and use edk2-basetools pip module if available.

### Custom

BaseTools/Bin**Pip**Wrappers/WindowsLike or BaseTools/Bin**Pip**Wrappers/PosixLike path must be set instead of BaseTools/BinWrappers/WindowsLike or BaseTools/BinWrappers/UnixLike

## Contribution Process

This project welcomes all types of contributions.
For issues, bugs, and questions it is best to open a [github issue](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-basetools/issues).
