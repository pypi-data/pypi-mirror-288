# YouTube Complete API

This Python package provides a unified interface for the YouTube Data API and YouTube Transcript API, allowing easy access to both video details and transcripts with a single package.

## Features

- Retrieve video details including title, description, views, and likes.
- Fetch video transcripts, including automatically generated and translated versions.

## Installation

To install this package, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install youtube-complete-api
```

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.

## Getting Started

Before you can use the YouTube APIs, you'll need to obtain an API key from [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).

### Usage Example

Here's a quick example to get you started:

```python
from youtube_complete_api import YouTubeClient

# Initialize the client with your YouTube API key
client = YouTubeClient(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')

# Get video details
video_details = client.get_video_details('VIDEO_ID')
print(video_details)

# Get video transcript
transcript = client.get_transcript('VIDEO_ID')
print(transcript)
```

Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual YouTube API key and `'VIDEO_ID'` with the ID of the YouTube video you want to query.

## Documentation

For more detailed information about the API functionalities, please refer to the [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) and [YouTube Transcript API](https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api) documentation pages.
