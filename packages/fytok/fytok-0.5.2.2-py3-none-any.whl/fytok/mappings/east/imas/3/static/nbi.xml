            Basic Information
            Description: Neutral Beam Injection (NBI) System

            State: Active

            Responsible person(s):Chundong HU (ext: 63146)

            Group leader: Chundong HU (ext: 63146)

            Location: Horizontal ports A &amp; F

            Specifications
            Beam Energy: 50~80 keV

            Beam Power: 0~4 MW per beam line

            Beam Pulse: 0~100 s

            NBI System
            Neutral beam injection system (NBIS) is one of the most effective heating and current drive system for EAST. The system is designed to comprise two sets of neutral beam injector(NBI). Its layout is shown in Fig.1.

            The global specifications of the NBIS can be described as follows:

            Max beam power : 8 MW (4 MWX2)
            Beam species: D0
            Max beam energy: 80 keV
            Max Pulse length: &gt; 100 s (with modulation)
            Each of the two NBIs has separate sub-system and can operate independently. Its schematics can be seen from Fig.2. It is about 6 m long from the exit grid of ion source to the center of EAST plasma. The estimated weight of the beamline is about 40 metric tons. The beam centerline is 6.18 m above the ground floor, which is the same height as the EAST midplane. The beamline consists of vacuum vessel, neutralizer, bending magnet, ion dump, calorimeter and cryopanels. The vacuum vessel is divided into three parts. The rear cryopanel, neutralizer and ion dump are installed in the first part. The bending magnet is installed in the second part. The front cryopanel and calorimeter are installed in the third part.

            During the last two EAST experimental campaigns, EAST-NBIS has displayed good performance and contributed to the impressive results of EAST. However, some damages and problems had also revealed during the operation. After a series of maintenance and improvement, the EAST-NBIS is expected to have a better performance in the oncoming EAST experimental campaign. And the performance prediction is listed in Table 1. Table 1 Performance prediction of EAST-NBIS

            EAST-NBI-1	EAST-NBI-2
            Beam Energy	Up to 70 keV	Up to 70 keV
            Beam Power	3 MW	3 MW
            Beam Pulse	Up to 100 s (with modulation)	Up to 100 s (with modulation)
