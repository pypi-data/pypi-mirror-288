--------------------
You can run FAST-OAD-CS25 notebooks **without installation** using our
[Binder-hosted Jupyter notebooks](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD_CS25.git/latest-release?filepath=src%2Ffastoad_cs25%2Fnotebooks).


Install
-------

**Prerequisite**:FAST-OAD needs at least **Python 3.8.0**.

It is recommended (but not required) to do the install in a virtual
environment ([conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/),
[venv](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/venv.html), ...)

Once Python is installed, installation can be done using pip. FAST-OAD, the core software, will be
installed at the same time.

> **Note**: If your network uses a proxy, you may have to do [some
> settings](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#using-a-proxy-server)
> for pip to work correctly

You can install the latest version (including the main software FAST-OAD) with this command:

``` {.bash}
$ pip install --upgrade fast-oad-cs25
```
