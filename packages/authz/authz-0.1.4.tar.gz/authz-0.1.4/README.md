## Overview

Provide a brief introduction to the AuthZ permission system and how this SDK can be used to integrate it into Python applications.

## Installation

To install the AuthZ Python SDK, run:

```bash
pip install authz
```

### Additional Notes

- Ensure you have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed in your environment. If you don't have it installed, you can follow the instructions on the Poetry website.
- You may need to authenticate with the Git repository if it's private. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the repository.

### Installing with Poetry (Recommended)

You can directly install the `authz-python` package from its Git repository using Poetry. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
poetry add git+https://e.coding.net/cloudbase-100009281119/authz/authz-python.git
```

This command will add the `authz-python` package as a dependency to your project and install it along with any other dependencies it requires.

### Installing with Poetry (Manual)

To install the AuthZ Python SDK using Poetry, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from the remote URL:

  ```bash
  git clone https://e.coding.net/cloudbase-100009281119/authz/authz-python.git
  ```

2. Change to the cloned directory:

  ```bash
  cd authz-python
  ```

3. Install the package and its dependencies using Poetry:

  ```bash
  poetry install
  ```

### Using pip (Alternative)

If you prefer to use pip, you can install the package directly from the cloned repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://e.coding.net/cloudbase-100009281119/authz/authz-python.git
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the AuthZ Python SDK:

```python
from authz.client import Client

# Initialize the client with your credentials
client = Client(client_id="your_client_id", provider="https://authz.example.com", client_secret="your_client_secret")

# Use the client to interact with the AuthZ system
# Example: Authorize a request
# ...
```
