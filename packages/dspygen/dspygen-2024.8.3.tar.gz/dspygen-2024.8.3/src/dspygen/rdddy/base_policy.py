    rules and conditions into actionable guidance. Policies play a crucial role in defining the behavior of the
    system under various circumstances, ensuring that operations adhere to the defined business logic and
    constraints. Through extending AbstractPolicy, developers can encapsulate and enforce the strategic and
    operational rules that drive the domain's functionality, ensuring consistency and alignment with business
