## How to use

This lib provides a
[`Card`](https://gkteco.github.io/nbdev_cards/card.html#card) class you
can use to create, display, and compare playing cards:

``` python
c = Card(suit=1, rank=1)
```

``` python
c
```

    Card(rank=A, suit=dimonds)

Suits are numbered according to this list:

``` python
suits
```

    ['spades', 'dimonds', 'hearts', 'clovers']

and these ranks:

``` python
ranks
```

    [None, 'A', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'J', 'Q', 'K']
