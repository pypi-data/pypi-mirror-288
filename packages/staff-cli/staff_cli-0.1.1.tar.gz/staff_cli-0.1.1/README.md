**Staff** is a toolkit for dead-simple usage out of the box promts and llms in your project and command line.

DRY & magic flow is a core principle.

Current state is WIP.

## Idea/Vision

Any good prompt combined with a llm is a pure magic. And you don't need to repeat yourself and find a good prompt, you can find well-prepared by community grimoires (combination of prompt, agents, functions & llms or only a prompt) then you learn this grimoire and can you use it on any text. Staff can help you with mastering your grimoires. Be brave in your path.

Structure of the Grimoire 0.1 version:

```md
---
title:
description:
tags: []
author:
---

[//]: # (SYSTEM)\n
Here any System prompt...

[//]: # (USER)\n
Here any User prompt...
```

You can use a grimoire with such packed of knowledge structure or it can be just a simple text without any metatags or SYSTEM/USER prompts. In that case everything is a SYSTEM prompt.

In the future version I want to add support for models & functions.
