    'long_description': "Version: `v0.0.8`\n\n# py-nest-thermostat\n\nPython CLI Nest Controller and Reporting Tool.\n\n**Build it with me on Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/datafrittata**\n\n**Disclaimer:**\nThis project is very much work in progress while in version 0 anything can change, anything can break and some parts of the code are probably very ugly. Feel free to test it, contribute (see [CONTRIBUTING.md]()), report bugs\n\n**Get device stats:**\n\n![py nest stats](https://p20.f4.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/04uLgQmW/7f9ac5f0-cd31-4168-a681-efa311ae149b.gif?source=viewer&v=9e16a3d3f159925ea81c1be805a2144e)\n\n**Set Device Temperature:**\n\n![py nest set temp](https://p20.f4.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/JruG7ok0/7527e6c4-ba14-4447-8345-8dfa9a1bb32c.gif?source=viewer&v=09fb7a9c4370d84d69cd25535d714b49)\n\n## Features:\n\n- print device stats\n- set target temperature\n\n## Future Features:\n\n- capture device statistics into a database\n- plot device statistics over time\n- some ML?\n\n# Installation\n\nThe tool is intallable from [PyPI](https://pypi.org) via `pip` or [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/). But you must first set up access via Google's Developer console (which currently costs a one time $5 fee and is a bit of a pain).\n\n## Set Up Google and Authorization\n\nThis part of the process is a real pain, especially if you've never set up Authorization via Google. Luckily [Wouter Nieuwerth](https://www.wouternieuwerth.nl/about/) made a really nice [guide](https://www.wouternieuwerth.nl/controlling-a-google-nest-thermostat-with-python/) with pictures that I encourage you to check out\n\n### Google Documentation Links\n\nGoogle has some pretty extensive documentation:\n\n- [Nest Getting Started](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/get-started)\n- [Device Registration](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/registration)\n\nOnce setup, you will be able to access your nest devicesc, and manage your authorizations in the following places:\n\n- [Nest Device Access](https://console.nest.google.com/device-access/)\n- [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)\n\nIf you have issues, and neither the [step by step guide from Wouter](https://www.wouternieuwerth.nl/controlling-a-google-nest-thermostat-with-python/) nor the links above help you feel free to open an issue and if I have time I'll try and help out.\n\n## Install `py-nest-thermostat`\n\nIf you want to be able to access the tool from anywhere I recomment setting it up via [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/). Pipx will give you access to `py-nest` globally while keeping it in an isolated python virtual environment. The best of both worlds really!\n\nYou can install with pipx like so:\n\n```bash\npipx install py-nest-thermostat\n```\n\n## Create your credentials file\n\n`nest` expects your credentials and other handy authentication parameters to be in an file named `config.yaml` and it should be placed at this location `~/.py-nest-thermostat/`. We might implement the possibility to pass a custom location later. If you're too impatient feel free to help out! :)\n\nYou can find an example of this file [here](./config.yaml.sample)\n\nIf you prefer to use regular `pip`, follow those steps:\n\n1. create a python3 virtual environment (with `venv` or `virtualenv` --up to you)\n2. activate the virtual environment (`source /path/to/virtual/environment`)\n3. `pip install py-nest-thermostat`\n\n# Usage\n\nUntil I write some more extensive docs, once you have installed the tool use use the CLI `--help` command\n\n```bash\nnest --help\n```\n",
