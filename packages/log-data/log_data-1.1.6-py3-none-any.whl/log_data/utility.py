# what am I looking for?
# file name, -> filename,split,last item
#     - Based on experiments, the file name is the directory where the file actually is, and not the file that executed it.
#     - Since I am logging packages, I need to know where the package is. 
#     - pip show pip can show that. 
# package name ->
