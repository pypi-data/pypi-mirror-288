## Campaign Stopping

# Based on the insights from
# [this other example](/examples/Custom_Hooks/probability_of_improvement), we now
# demonstrate how to leverage the
# {func}`register_hooks <baybe.utils.basic.register_hooks>`
# mechanics to interrupt a running campaign based on a simple *Probability of
# Improvement (PI)* criterion. This approach could be used, for instance, to terminate
# unpromising campaigns early and refine their search spaces, or to end an ongoing
# optimization if the found results are sufficiently good.
# The underlying use case is taken from the example shown
# [here](/examples/Backtesting/full_lookup).

### Settings

# Let's start by defining some basic settings required for the example:

SMOKE_TEST = "SMOKE_TEST" in os.environ

N_MC_ITERATIONS = 2 if SMOKE_TEST else 20
N_INTERRUPTED_CAMPAIGNS = 2 if SMOKE_TEST else 5

### Problem Definition and Lookup Functionality

# Following the setup described [here](../Backtesting/full_lookup.md), we create the
# building blocks for the optimization problem:

}

searchspace = SearchSpace.from_product(parameters=parameters)

recommender = TwoPhaseMetaRecommender(
    initial_recommender=RandomRecommender(), recommender=BotorchRecommender()
)

# Also, we load the dataframe containing the lookup data for the closed-loop simulation:

try:
    lookup = pd.read_excel("./../Backtesting/lookup.xlsx")
except FileNotFoundError:
    lookup = pd.read_excel("examples/Backtesting/lookup.xlsx")


### Simulating the Uninterrupted Campaigns

# First, we run several Monte Carlo repetitions of the uninterrupted campaign to get a
# feeling for the average trajectory. For reproducibility, we also fix the random seed:

campaign = Campaign(searchspace, objective, recommender)
results_uninterrupted = simulate_scenarios(
    {"Average uninterrupted": campaign},
    lookup,
    batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,
    n_doe_iterations=N_DOE_ITERATIONS,
    n_mc_iterations=N_MC_ITERATIONS,
    random_seed=RANDOM_SEED,
)


### Defining the Campaign-Stopping Hook

# In order to interrupt a running campaign, we define a custom exception to identify our
# stopping event:


class CampaignStoppedException(Exception):
    """The campaign should be stopped."""


# Based on this exception class, we can now define a hook implementing the stopping
# criterion. For this purpose, we count the fraction of candidates with a PI exceeding a
# given value and terminate the campaign once the fraction falls below a certain
# threshold.

PI_THRESHOLD = 0.01  # PI of 1% to identify promising points
PI_REQUIRED_FRACTION = 0.2  # 20% of candidates must be above the threshold


def stop_on_PI(
    self: BotorchRecommender,
    searchspace: SearchSpace,
    objective: Objective | None = None,
    measurements: pd.DataFrame | None = None,
) -> None:
    """Raise an exception if the PI-based stopping criterion is fulfilled."""
    if searchspace.type != SearchSpaceType.DISCRETE:
        raise TypeError(
            f"Search spaces of type '{searchspace.type}' are not supported. "
            f"Currently, only search spaces of type '{SearchSpaceType.DISCRETE}' are "
            f"accepted."
        )
    train_x = searchspace.transform(measurements, allow_extra=True)
    train_y = objective.transform(measurements)
    acqf = ProbabilityOfImprovement()

    botorch_acqf = acqf.to_botorch(self.surrogate_model, searchspace, train_x, train_y)
    _, candidates_comp_rep = searchspace.discrete.get_candidates(
        allow_repeated_recommendations=self.allow_repeated_recommendations,
        allow_recommending_already_measured=self.allow_recommending_already_measured,
    )
    comp_rep_tensor = to_tensor(candidates_comp_rep).unsqueeze(1)
    acqf_values = botorch_acqf(comp_rep_tensor)

    n_pis_over = torch.sum(acqf_values > PI_THRESHOLD)
    n_pis_over_required = math.ceil(len(candidates_comp_rep) * PI_REQUIRED_FRACTION)
    if n_pis_over < n_pis_over_required:
        raise CampaignStoppedException(
            f"Less than {PI_REQUIRED_FRACTION*100:.0f}% of candidates are above the PI "
            f"threshold of {PI_THRESHOLD*100:.0f}% - Stopping the campaign."
        )


# Now, we attach the hook to the ``recommend`` function of our recommender class:

BotorchRecommender.recommend = register_hooks(
    BotorchRecommender.recommend, post_hooks=[stop_on_PI]
)

# ```{admonition} Monkeypatching
# :class: note
# The above monkeypatch registers the hook with all future instances of the recommender
# class. While it is possible to attach the hook only to a specific instance via
# ``MethodType`` (see [here](./basics.md)), this approach does not work well with the
# simulation utilities because they internally create deep copies of the simulated
# campaign, effectively bypassing the patch.
# ```

### Simulating the Interrupted Campaigns

# With the hook attached to the class, we again run several Monte Carlo repetitions of
# the same campaign. For this purpose, we instantiate a new recommender with the active
# hook and assign it to a fresh copy of the campaign:

recommender_with_hook = TwoPhaseMetaRecommender(
    initial_recommender=RandomRecommender(), recommender=BotorchRecommender()
)
campaign_with_hook = Campaign(searchspace, objective, recommender)

# Now, we can simply re-trigger the simulation loop. In order to establish a 1:1
# comparison, we use the same random seed as before so that the initial states of all
# trajectories are aligned with the previous runs:

results_interrupted = simulate_scenarios(
    {"Interrupted": campaign_with_hook},
    lookup,
    batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,
    n_doe_iterations=N_DOE_ITERATIONS,
    n_mc_iterations=N_INTERRUPTED_CAMPAIGNS,
    random_seed=RANDOM_SEED,
)

# ```{note}
# If an exception is thrown inside the loop, the function still returns the partial
# trajectory, which effectively implements early stopping.
# ```


### Plotting the Results

# Finally, we plot both the interrupted and the uninterrupted results.
# To display the latter in terms of individual trajectories, we can leverage the column
# that keeps track of the Monte Carlo iterations:

results_interrupted = results_interrupted.drop("Scenario", axis=1)
results_interrupted["Scenario"] = results_interrupted["Monte_Carlo_Run"].apply(
    lambda k: f"PI-stopped, run {k}"
)

# Now, we can easily create the plot from a single combined dataframe:

results = pd.concat([results_uninterrupted, results_interrupted])
ax = sns.lineplot(
    data=results,
    marker="o",
    markersize=10,
    x="Num_Experiments",
    y="yield_CumBest",
    hue="Scenario",
)
for line in ax.get_lines()[1:]:
    line.set_dashes([5, 2])
create_example_plots(ax=ax, base_name="campaign_stopping")
