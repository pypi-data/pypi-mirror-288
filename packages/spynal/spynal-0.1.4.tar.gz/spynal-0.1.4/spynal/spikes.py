"""
Preprocessing, basic analyses, and plotting of neural spiking activity

Overview
--------
Functionality includes computing spike rates (using binning or spike density methods) and their
statistict, inter-spike intervals and their statistics, and spike data preprocessing and plotting.

Most functions expect one of two formats of spiking data:

- **bool**
    Binary spike trains where 1's label times of spikes and 0's = no spike, in a Numpy ndarray
    of dtype=bool, where one axis corresponds to time, but otherwise can have any arbitrary
    dimensionality (including other optional axes corresponding to trials, units, etc.)

- **timestamp**
    Explicit spike timestamps in a Numpy ndarray of dtype=object. This is a "ragged nested
    sequence" (array of lists/sub-arrays of different length), analogous to Matlab cell arrays.
    Each object element is a variable-length list-like 1D subarray of spike timestamps
    (of dtype float or int), and the container object array can have any arbitrary dimensionality
    (including optional axes corresponding to trials, units, etc.).

    Alternatively, for a single spike train, a simple 1D list or ndarray of timestamps
    may be given instead.

Most functions perform operations in a mass-univariate manner. This means that
rather than embedding function calls in for loops over units, trials, etc., like this::

    for unit in units:
        for trial in trials:
            results[trial,unit] = compute_something(data[trial,unit])

You can instead execute a single call on ALL the data, labeling the relevant axis
for the computation (usually time here), and it will run in parallel (vectorized)
across all units, trials, etc. in the data, like this:

``results = compute_something(data, axis)``

    """
    Compute spike density function (smoothed rate) via convolution with given kernel

    Spiking data can be timestamps or binary (0/1) spike trains

    NOTE: Spike densities exhibit "edge effects" where rate is biased downward at temporal limits
    of data, due to convolution kernel extending past edge of data and summing in zeros.

    The best way to avoid this is to request `lims` that are well within the temporal limits of
    the data. We also ameliorate this by extending the requested `lims` temporarily by a buffer,
    which is trimmed off to the requested `lims` before returning the computed density.

    Also, for binary spike data, if lims +/- buffer extend beyond the temporal limits of the data,
    we symmetrically reflect the data around its limits (note this can't be done for timestamp
    data as we don't know the data's temporal limits).

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : ndarray, shape=Any, dtype=object (each element = (n_spikes,) array)
        or ndarray, shape=(...,n_timepts,...), dtype=bool

        List(s) of spike timestamps (in s).  Can be given for either a single spike train,
        or for multiple spike trains (eg different trials, units, etc.) within an object array
        of any arbitrary shape.
        *or*
        Binary/boolean representation of spike times, for either a single or multiple spike trains.

    lims : array-like, shape=(2,)
        Desired time range of returned spike density ([start,end] in s).
        For boolean spike data, defaults to (timepts[0],timepts[-1]).
        For spike timestamp data, a value MUST be input.

        NOTE: For either data type, lims should be within (or equal to) the full
        extent of the data itself. We test this for binary spike data, but we
        don't know the actual extent of timestamp data, so that is up to the user!

    width : scalar, default: (kernel-dependent)
        Width parameter (in s) for given convolution kernel.
        Interpretation is specific to value of `kernel`:

        - 'gaussian' : `width` = standard deviation, default: 0.50 (50 ms)
        - 'hanning' : `width` = half-width (~ 2.53x Gaussian SD), default: 0.125 (125 ms)

    step : scalar, default: 0.001 (1 ms)
        Spacing (in s) between successive time points in returned spike density.
        Values > 1 ms imply some downsampling from original spike train time sampling.
        NOTE: Must be an integer multiple of original data sampling (1 ms for timestamp data).
        NOTE: This argument replaces `downsmp` in previous versions.

    kernel : str or ndarray or callable, default: 'gaussian'
        Convolution kernel to use. Can be given as kernel name, with current options:

        - 'gaussian' : Gaussian kernel
        - 'hanning' : Hanning kernel

        Alternatively, can input any arbitrary kernel as an array of float values
        or as a custom function that can take any additional kwargs as arguments
        and return an array.

    buffer : float, default: (kernel-dependent, approximates length of kernel's edge effects)
        Length (in s) of symmetric buffer to add to each end of time dimension
        (and trim off before returning) to avoid edge effects. Kernel defaults:

        - 'gaussian' : 3*`width`  (3x std dev)
        - 'hanning' : `width` (half-width of kernel)

    axis : int, default: -1 (last axis of array)
        Axis of binary data corresponding to time dimension. Not used for spike timestamp data.

    timepts : ndarray, shape=(n_timepts,)
        Time sampling vector (in s) for binary data.
        Not used for spike timestamp data, but MUST be input for binary data.

    **kwargs :
        All other kwargs passed directly to kernel function

    Returns
    -------
    rates : ndarray, shape=(...,n_timepts_out) or (...,n_timepts_out,...), dtype=float
        Spike density function -- smoothed spike rates (in spk/s) estimated at each
        timepoint (and for each trial/unit/etc. in `data`).

        For timestamp data, same dimensionality as `data`, with time axis appended to end.
        For boolean data, same dimensionality as `data`.
        If only a single spike train is input, output is (n_timepts_out,) vector.

    axis : int or None or 'each', default: 'each'
        Axis of ISI data to pool ISIs along before computing stat.
        eg, for data that is shape (n_trials,n_units), if you want to compute a stat value

        Data is ultimately transformed to timestamp format for vector graphics plots, and to binary
        format for bitmap/raster graphics plots. Therefore, if the "wrong" format is input for a
        requested graphics type, you must also input additional keyword args required by the data
        format transformation functions -- :func:`bool_to_times` requires a value `timepts`;
        :func:`times_to_bool`) requires a value for either `lims` or `bins` (see functions
        for details).

        NOTE: Since raster plots are 2-dimensional (time x trials/units/etc.), data here has
        stricter shape requirements than other functions -- it can have at most 1 dimension
        other than time. That is, timestamp object arrays must be 1D (length=n_spike_trains);
        binary spike data must be <= 2D (shape=n_spike_trains,n_timepts).

    ax : Pyplot Axis object, default: plt.gca()
        Axis to plot into

    graphics : {'bitmap','vector'}, default: 'bitmap' for binary data, 'vector' for timestamps
        Type of graphics to use for plotting rasters:

        - Vector graphics using :func:`plt.plot`. Individual spikes rendered as line objects
            that are manipulatable in vector graphics software like Adobe Illustrator, but much slower.

        - Bitmapped (aka raster) graphics using :func:plt.imshow. Full raster plot rendered as
            single (unmanipulatable) image, but plots much faster. (Note: "raster graphics" is a
            term from computer graphics that is unrelated to "raster plots" in electrophysiology.)
        
        NOTE: In some cases, a substantial number of spikes "disappear" from bitmap plots. This
        seems to happen when plotting into smaller figures (eg inline/within-IDE plots or
        default-size separate-window figures), and when these figures are save to bitmap-based
        file formats (eg png, jpg). This problem doesn't seem to happen when you plot into
        full-screen separate-window figures (see :func:`plots.full_figure`), when figures are saved
        into vector-based file formats (eg pdf, eps), or when figures are saved to bitmap-based
        formats (eg png) using our version of savefig() :func:`plots.savefig`.

    color : Matplotlib color specifier, default: '0.25' (dark gray)
        Color to plot all spikes in

    height : float, default: 1.0 (each spike height is full range for its row in raster)
        Height of each plotted spike (in fraction of distance btwn spike trains).
        Only used for vector graphics version (height always 1 for bitmap/raster graphics).

    events : callable or array-like, shape=(n_events,)
        List of event values (eg times) to plot as markers on x-axis
        *or* callable function that will just plot the event markers itself.
        See :func:`plots.plot_markers` for details.
