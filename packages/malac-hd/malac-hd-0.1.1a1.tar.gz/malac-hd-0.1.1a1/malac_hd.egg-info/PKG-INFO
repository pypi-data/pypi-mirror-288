         Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
         Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
         of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
        
        
          This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
        the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
        License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
        
          0. Additional Definitions.
        
          As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
        General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
        General Public License.
        
          "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
        other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
        
          An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
        by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
        Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
        of using an interface provided by the Library.
        
          A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
        Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
        with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
        Version".
        
          The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
        Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
        for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
        based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
        
          The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
        object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
        and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
        Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
        
          1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
        
          You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
        without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
        
          2. Conveying Modified Versions.
        
          If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
        facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
        that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
        facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
        version:
        
           a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
           ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
           function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
           whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
        
           b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
           this License applicable to that copy.
        
          3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
        
          The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
        a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
        code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
        material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
        layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
        (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
        
           a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
           Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
           covered by this License.
        
           b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
           document.
        
          4. Combined Works.
        
          You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
        taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
        portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
        engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
        the following:
        
           a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
           the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
           covered by this License.
        
           b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
           document.
        
           c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
           execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
           these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
           copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
        
           d) Do one of the following:
        
               0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
               License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
               suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
               recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
               the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
               manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
               Corresponding Source.
        
               1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
               Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
               a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
               system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
               of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
               Version.
        
           e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
           be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
           GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
           necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
           Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
           Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
           you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
           the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
           Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
           Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
           for conveying Corresponding Source.)
        
          5. Combined Libraries.
        
          You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
        Library side by side in a single library together with other library
        facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
        License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
        choice, if you do both of the following:
        
           a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
           on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
           conveyed under the terms of this License.
        
           b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
           is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
           accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
        
          6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
        
          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
        of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
        versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
        differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
        
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
        Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
        of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
        applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
        conditions either of that published version or of any later version
        published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
        received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
        General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
        General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
        
          If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
        whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
        apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
        permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
        Library.

# MaLaC-HD

MaLaC-HD (MApping LAnguage Compiler for Health Data) is a tool that you can use to convert mappings between different health data formats to executable code. It can also be used as a library to dynamically execute mappings.

## Why?

When having parallel operations of some sort or another, there is one requirement that is challenging in the context of standardized APIs: mapping data, to make it accessible to the different worlds at least.

There are many methods to map from one semi-structured data format to another. Most of the times, when a mapping requirement reveals, it is solved by a quick small script. After some time, that script needs technical or rule updates. As the rules are directly coded, they can only be altered by someone having knowledge about the mapping content, the mapping rules and the mapping technology. 

To divide these concerns, HL7 FHIR created resources for mapping purposes, like the [StructureMap](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/structuremap.html) for [transformation](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/structuremap-operation-transform.html) and [ConceptMap](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/conceptmap.html) for [translation](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/conceptmap-operation-translate.html). Additionally a more human readable metalanguage for creating such StructureMap and ConceptMap resources was created, called [FHIR Mapping Language, or in short FML](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/mapping-language.html). Interestingly enough, FML is not restricted to FHIR as a source or target for the mapping. It could also be used i.e. to map from HL7 CDA to OHDSI OMOP CDM.

Current FML or StructureMap/ConceptMap tools are quite slow in the transformation/translation of the content to be mapped, as both steps, the processing of the rules and the transformation/translation itself is done every time. As a gold standard and sparring partner for this project, the Canadian open source project [HAPI](https://github.com/hapifhir) with its Suisse extension [matchbox](https://www.matchbox.health/) has been used. Additionally, we got notice about some Italian project speeding up matchbox, but couldn't find any public references.

We can't use current tools to map data synchronously, as nearly all mapping executions need more time than the [dorethy threshold of 0.4 seconds](https://lawsofux.com/doherty-threshold/), resulting in the users perception of "it got stuck". Also the practical, but restricted FHIR mapping language does not offer any possibilities to extend it with further functions, in contrast to the StructureMap and ConceptMap resources themselves, that could be easily extended.

## How?

Focusing on but not restricting to the health information technology world, a partnership was created out of the experts in the CDA2FHIR HL7 Austria Working Group, to solve this issue. On one side with expertise in research and on the other side with expertise in EHRs.

By applying the MVP concept of build-measure-learn-repeat, first versions were created and tested against already existing FML-mappings in the HL7 community and matchbox as a mapping tool. 

As the partners are themselves heavy users of the resulting MVPs, using them immediately after release, quick iterations of four months are planned.

## What?

MaLaC-HD is intended to focus on transformation speed and easy extensibility after compilation/convertion. This is achieved by seperation of 
* the processing from FML to StructureMap/ConceptMap, 
* the conversion from StructureMap/ConceptMap to python code, 
* the execution of the translation itself from source to target. 
It uses the mappings and requirements of some preliminary projects (i.e. https://github.com/HL7Austria/CDA2FHIR) as testing data.

MaLaC-HD is not limited to the use of FML or StructureMap/ConceptMap for the translation, but has already implemented a conversion from StructureMap/ConceptMaps to python code. It can be used to transform/translate different input formats to different output formats, using some conversion/mapping rule language and the XSD or JSON schemas of the input and output format. It also makes it easier to develop new conversion or mapping rule languages, further input formats and/or extensions.

## Pursued Objectives
The development of MaLaC-HD focuses on the following three main objectives and their respective sub-objectives:

- The compilation of the conversion/mapping rules by MaLaC-HD and the resulting mapping of these rules in a common programming language must be easily readable and directly related to the conversion/mapping rules.
  - The conversion/mapping rules must be ballotable so that they can be queried and discussed for completeness and correctness as part of a guideline or even as a standalone part in a community, such as the HL7 community.
- MaLaC-HD must not be dependent on any conversion rule language in order to be able to easily process conversion/mapping rules that can be mapped in different conversion rule languages.
  - In particular, the limits of the respective conversion rule language require simple narrative extensibility in order to draw attention to the fact that further code must be added manually in the respective generated code by means of placeholders.
- The result of compiling the conversion/mapping rules must be trimmed for speed and stability so as not to add any obstructive delays.
  - The compiled conversion/mapping rules should be executable as stand-alone program code without MaLaC-HD.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running.

### Installation

Install malac-hd and its dependencies via pip:

```
pip install malac-hd
```

... or, if you want to build from source:


```
git clone https://gitlab.com/cdehealth/malac-hd.git
cd malac-hd
pip install -e .
```

#### Preparing your FML maps

As the direct support of FML will come with the beta version this fall, a workaround has to be done right now in the alpha, by pre-compiling/converting the FML to StructreMaps and ConceptMaps by using the [java-validator](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/validator/), i.e.:
```
java -jar .\validator_cli.jar -ig ./tests/structuremap/aut_lab/cdaToBundle.map -output tests/structuremap/aut_lab/cda-2-bundle-merged-transform.4.fhir.xml -compile http://hl7.at/fhir/HL7ATCoreProfiles/4.0.1/StructureMap/at-cda-to-bundle -version 4.0
```

### Using MaLaC-HD

with `malac-hd --help` you will get an overview:

```
____________________ MaLaC-HD 0.1.1+20240516-alpha started ____________________
usage: malac-hd [-h] -m MAPPING [-co CONVERT_OUTPUT] [-ti TRANSFORM_INPUT] [-to TRANSFORM_OUTPUT] [-s]

This is the MApping LAnguage Compiler for Health Data, short MaLaC-HD. We differentiate between two modes, converting and transforming. The convertion is compiling a given mapping to python code, that itself can be run with its own argument handling for transforming inputs. Additionally, the transformation can   
also be be done by MaLaC-HD directly after convertion, i.e. for direct testing purposes.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m MAPPING, --mapping MAPPING
                        the mapping file path, the conversion/mapping rule language is detected by file ending, right now only StructureMaps and ConceptMaps can be given as mappings
  -co CONVERT_OUTPUT, --convert_output CONVERT_OUTPUT
                        the conversion python file path, if not given, saved in the working directory with the map-file name
  -ti TRANSFORM_INPUT, --transform_input TRANSFORM_INPUT
                        the transformation input file path, the ressource type is detected by its root node inside the xml
  -to TRANSFORM_OUTPUT, --transform_output TRANSFORM_OUTPUT
                        the transformation output file path, the ressource type is detected by its root node inside the xml
  -s, --silent          do not print the converted python mapping to console
```

#### Example Usage 

Usage of an in MaLaC-HD included example:
```
malac-hd -m ./tests/structuremap/aut_lab/cda-2-bundle-merged-transform.4.fhir.xml -co ./tests/structuremap/aut_lab/out/bundle.4.fhir.xml.py -i ./tests/structuremap/aut_lab/Lab_Allgemeiner_Laborbefund.at.cda.xml -to ./tests/structuremap/aut_lab/out/bundle.4.fhir.xml
