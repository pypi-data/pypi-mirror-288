# PYDAQ - Data Acquisition and Experimental Analysis with Python


----
Using Python for applications with experimental data (Arduino and NIDAQ boards)
----

This package was firstly designed to use experimental device for data 
acquisition and signal generator, when performing different experiment, 
such as a step-response test. 

Despite this, one can use PYDAQ to acquire and send a signal from 
any system, using different boards [(check jupyter notebook examples folder)](examples), 
through a Graphical User Interface or via command line. In this sense
the user is capable to generate a customized signal which can be easily
applied to a system. 

It is noteworthy that this application makes data acquisition and 
empirical experiments simpler, faster and easier. This is relevant
when the user needs empirical data to construct black box linear and
nonlinear models, commomly used in research projects in forecasting and 
model-based control schemes.
 
The code provided here allows user to save acquired data in .dat files in 
a path specified by the user (or at Desktop, if no path is provided), as well
as send a user-defined data, which can be any nonlinear input signal 
[(you are strongly advised to check the )](https://samirmartins.github.io/pydaq/)

Installation and Requirements
---

The fastest way to install PYDAQ is using pip:

```console
pip install pydaq
```

**NOTE:** In this version of pydaq (0.0.3), [(NI-DAQmx drivers)](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daq-mx.html#494676) must be installed, even if 
the user is only using Arduino Boards. This issue will be addressed in future versions, allowing
Arduino users to use PYDAQ without having to install NI-DAQmx drivers.

PYDAQ requires:

- Installed driver of the board used (Arduino or National Instruments NIDAQ)
- nidaqmx (>=0.6.5) for data acquisition from National Instruments Boards
- matplotlib (>=3.5.3) as a visualization tool
- numpy (>=1.22.3) to process data
- PySide6 (>=6.7.1), PySide6_Addons, PySide6_Essentials and shiboken6 as a Graphical User Interface framework
- pyserial (>=3.5) to manage data to/from Arduino
