# CMS Plone Chart for CDK8S

This chart provides a library to bootstrap a Plone deployment on a Kubernetes cluster using the [CDK8S](https://cdk8s.io) framework.

It provides

* backend (with `plone.volto` or Classic-UI)
* frontend (Plone-Volto, a ReactJS based user interface)
* varnish (optional)

## Usage

For now have a look at the [example project](https://github.com/bluedynamics/cdk8s-plone-example)..

## Development

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Then run the following command to run the test:

```bash
npx projen test
```

### WIP Checklist:

Each step need to be implemented with tests!

* [ ] Start Backend

  * [x] deployment
  * [x] service
  * [x] pdb
  * [ ] init container running plone-site-create
  * [x] lifecycle checks (readiness, liveness)
  * [x] generic way to inject sidecars
* [ ] Start Frontend

  * [x] deployment
  * [x] service
  * [x] pdb
  * [ ] lifecycle checks (readiness, liveness)
  * [ ] depend on ready/live backend (needed?)
  * [x] generic way to inject sidecars
* [ ] Start Varnish

  * [ ] deployment

    * [ ] do not depend on backend/front end to be  up, but configure to deliver from cache if possible.
  * [ ] service
  * [ ] pdb
  * [ ] lifecycle checks (readiness, liveness)
  * [ ] generic way to inject sidecars
  * find a way to purge caches. based on kitconcept varnish purger? needs
* [ ] Other Languages

  * [x] Check Python distribution
  * [ ] Check Java distribution
  * [ ] Check Go distribution
