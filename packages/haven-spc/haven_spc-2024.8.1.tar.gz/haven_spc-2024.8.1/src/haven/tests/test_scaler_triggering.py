"""The scaler has a global trigger, but individual channels.

These tests check the system for monitoring the trigger system in
bluesky so that it only fires the trigger once for all of the scaler
channels. Additionally, the scaler can send that trigger to other
devices, like the Xspress3 fluorescence detector readout electronics.
