Thanks for contributing to asdf!

Your PR should trigger the CI (after approval for first-time contributors)
which will:

- check your code for 'style' using pre-commit
- run your PR against the asdf unit tests for various OSes, python versions, and dependency versions
- perform a test build of your PR

It is highly recommended that you run some of these tests locally by:

- [installing pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#quick-start)
- [running pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/getting-started.html)

This will increase the chances your PR will pass the required CI tests.
