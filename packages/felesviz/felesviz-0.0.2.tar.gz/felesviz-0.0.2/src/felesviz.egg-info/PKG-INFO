```

### 2. Annotate Video
```
annotate --vid <path_to_video_file>
```
### 3. Global Flags
```
-T : View mask window.
--resume <existing-annotations-dir>: Continue from where you left off.
--skip <int(Frames)> : Frames to skip while processing a video file.
```

### 4. Mouse Controls
```
Click and Drag: Draw bounding boxes.
Double Click: Remove existing annotation.
```

## Display Annotations
Visualize your annotations using the `showlbls` command.
```
showlbls --img <single_image_or_a_directory> --ann <single_annotation_text_file_or_a_directory>
```

## Keyboard Navigation
```
N or D : Save and go to next image
B or A : Save and go back
C : Toggle clear screen (during annotation)
T : Toggle mask window (during annotation)
Q : Quit
```
