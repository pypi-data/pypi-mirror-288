# AniWorld Downloader

## Description

AniWorld Downloader is a command-line tool designed to download and stream content from aniworld.to.
It offers various features, including fetching single episodes, downloading entire seasons, organizing downloads into structured directories, and supporting multiple operating systems.

Windows is currently not supported as npyscreen does not work on Windows due to the curses module.
I will switch from npyscreen to another library that is maintained and supports Windows.

## Usage

> Install from pypi
```shell
pip install -U aniworld
```

> Run
```shell
aniworld
```
