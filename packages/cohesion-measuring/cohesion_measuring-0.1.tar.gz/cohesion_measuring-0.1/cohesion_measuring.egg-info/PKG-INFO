# Cohesion Calculator

This project contains the definitions of the `cohesion_calculator` library which calculates Sensitive Class Cohesion Metric (SCOM) based on provided JSON input. The folder `cohesion\cohesion_calculator` provides the full implementation code for this. You can adjust and expand this implementation for your needs.

Currently it can only be used locally, so whether you made adjustments or not, you have to build and install the library.

## Setup

### Install dependencies

1. Create a text file named requirements.txt with following content: `build  setuptools wheel twine pytest pytest-runner`

2. Install all neccessary requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Build library

Following command builds the library according to the definition provided in `setup.py`: `python -m build --wheel`

### (Optional) Run tests

`pytest tests.py`

### Install library

In the `dist` folder, a new whl-file should have been generated. Adjust the name accordingly.

`pip install "dist\cohesion_measuring-0.1-py3-none-any.whl"`

### Use library

The library can be imported like `import cohesion_calculator`

### NOT DONE YET - Publish to PyPI

The library has not yet been published.

`twine upload dist/\*`
`pip install cohesion_measuring`
