**Socket.io FastAPI integration library with first-class documentation using AsyncAPI**

The usage of the library is very familiar to the experience youâ€˜re used to in FastAPI. Automatic documentation, type hints everywhere and heavy use of Pydantic.

## Features

- First-class generated specification & documentation
- Uses [python_socketio](https://python-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) underneath
- Fully typed using pydantic, including the [AsyncAPI spec](./fastapi_sio/schemas/asyncapi.py)
- Streamlined emit to clients ([learn more in docs](./docs/emitting.md))
- Forces strictly to emit correct data type  ([see the example](./docs/example.md))

## Whatâ€˜s Missing?
  
- [ ] Serve AsyncAPI studio at /sio/docs
    - Unfortunately, AsyncAPI studio doesnâ€˜t work the same way as Swagger UI, there is currently no way to use CDN hosted built package and supply only single html file and URL with spec JSON
- [ ] Support for more obscure fields of AsyncAPI, such as `traits`, ...

## Usage Example

```python
fastapi_app = FastAPI()
sio_app = FastAPISIO(app=fastapi_app)

purr_channel = sio_app.create_emitter(
    "purrs",
    model=PurrModel,
    summary="Channel for purrs",
    description="Receive any purrs here!",
)

@sio_app.on(
    "rubs",
    model=BellyRubModel,
    summary="Channel for belly rubs",
    description="Send your belly rubs through here!",
)
async def handle_rub(sid, data):
    await purr_channel.emit(
        PurrModel(loudness=2, detail="Purr for all listeners")
    )
    return "Ack to the one who rubbed"
```

ðŸ‘‰ [Check out the example AsyncAPI documentation output!](https://studio.asyncapi.com/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marianhlavac/fastapi-sio/master/examples/from_readme_asyncapi.json)

By default (you can change these values):
 - the Socket.io endpoint path is **`/sio/socket.io`** (the `socket.io` part is set automatically by some clients)
 - The AsyncAPI spec file is at **`/sio/docs/asyncapi.json`**

Find more in the [examples](/docs/examples.md).

## Documentation & Reference

Refer to the [/docs](./docs/index.md) directory to learn how to use this library in your project.

_TODO: This documentation will be hosted on Github Pages in the near future, hopefully._
