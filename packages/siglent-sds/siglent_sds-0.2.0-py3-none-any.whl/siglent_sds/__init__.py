    :class:`~siglent_sds.connectors.SDS_Connector` sub-class. The connector class type (not an
    instance) to use should be passed in as the ``connector`` parameter. By default the
    :class:`~siglent_sds.connectors.SDS_Socket_Connector` will be used that connects via a
    networking socket. All parameters required by the connector (e.g. host ip address) are passed
    through using keyword arguments.

        #:
        #: - ``bandwidth_limit`` - Currently selected channel bandwidth limiter. 0 = off, 1 = 20 MHz, 2 = 200 MHz.
        #: - ``chunk_size_max`` - Maximum number of data points that can be transferred during a single waveform acquisition request.
        #: - ``code_per_div`` - Factor used in conversion of raw waveform ADC data to voltage.
        #: - ``frames_index`` - First frame index to transfer when in sequence mode.
        #: - ``frames_read`` - Number of frames transferred in a single waveform acquisition request when in sequence mode.
        #: - ``frames_sum`` - Total number of frames acquired when in sequence mode.
        #: - ``horizontal_interval`` - Time interval, in seconds, between each data point.
        #: - ``horizontal_offset`` - Horizontal offset in the time axis.
        #: - ``probe_attenuation`` - Attenuation setting selected for the probe, eg 1x or 10x.
        #: - ``time_base`` - Time interval, in seconds, between each horizontal division on the display.
        #: - ``vertical_gain`` - Voltage interval, in volts, between each vertical division on the display.
        #: - ``vertical_offset`` - Vertical offset in the voltage axis.
        #: - ``wave_array_interval`` - Interval between data points in acquired waveforms. For example, if set to 2, every second data point will be returned.
        #: - ``wave_array_max`` - Maximum number of data points possible in a single waveform acquisition. Note that if this is larger than ``chunk_size_max``, multiple waveform requests will be required to collect the entire waveform.

        #: - ``wave_array_start`` - Starting index of data points to transfer during waveform acquisition requests.

        Send a SCPI command to the device.

        In most cases responses are delimited by a newline ``b"\\n"``. Some commands do not produce
        a response, in which case ``delimiter=None`` or ``delimiter=b""`` should be used.

        For commands that respond with binary data prefixed with a header indicating the length of
        the response, such as ``"#9123456789"``, use ``binary=True``.

        Synchronous behaviour (blocking) can be enabled by setting the parameter ``block=True``. In
        this case the function will not return until the command has been processed by the device.
        Once the command has completed, any result will be returned as raw :class:`bytes`. If no
        reply is received from the device, empty bytes (``b""``) will be returned. If an error
        occurs during communications or processing of the response, the exception will be raised. If
        the function takes too long to complete, a :class:`TimeoutError` will be raised. The
        ``timeout`` parameter may be given to provide a custom timeout delay. If not provided, the
        default set by :attr:`block_timeout` will be used.

        Once the command has been processed the optional callback function will be called with the
        returned data. The callback method signature should be ``callback(data)`` where ``data``
        will be a :class:`bytes` object with the delimiter still appended.

        If the optional ``error_callback`` parameter is given, it should be a function of the form
        ``callback(ex)``, where ``ex`` will be an :class:`Exception` which describes the error. If
        an error occurs, the normal callback will not be called.

        Note that callbacks will still be made if synchronous behaviour is requested using the
        ``block=True`` parameter, and they will occur prior to this function returning.

        are specified using the form ``"C1"``, ``"C2"``, ``"C3"``, ``"C4"``. Math function channels
        are specified using ``"F1"``, ``"F2"`` etc. Lists of channels may be specified using any of

        The ``callback`` parameter should provide a function to call when the acquired data is

        ``data`` axis as the ``time`` parameter. It contains the time values corresponding to the
        waveform points, in seconds.

        The returned ``data`` will be a single multi-dimensional numpy array. The returned array
        will have shape [`channel_i`, `sequence_i`, `point_i`], where `channel_i` is the channel
        index, `sequence_i` is the waveform sequence index, and `point_i` is the waveform point
        index. Note that even if sequence mode is disabled, the array will still contain the
