## Typing stubs for pexpect

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`pexpect`](https://github.com/pexpect/pexpect) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`pexpect`.

This version of `types-pexpect` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `pexpect==4.9.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/pexpect. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit
[`3c7ffb1cc3847b8f4f940e02c6cfbd89090867e6`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/3c7ffb1cc3847b8f4f940e02c6cfbd89090867e6) and was tested
with mypy 1.11.1, pyright 1.1.374, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
