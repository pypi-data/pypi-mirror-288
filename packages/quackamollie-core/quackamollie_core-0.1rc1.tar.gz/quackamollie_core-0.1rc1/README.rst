Project description
===================
Quackamollie is a Telegram chat bot in Python using the library `aiogram` to serve LLM models running locally using Ollama.
This package is the core of the Quackamollie project.
It contains:

 - a command line interface which automatically discover addons declared as entrypoints.
 - the main commands, filters and callbacks for interacting with Quackamollie through Telegram
 - SQLAlchemy database connectors and models for Quackamollie
 - Alembic configuration to automatically migrate Postgres database
 - a docker-compose configuration to run a Postgres database
 - meta-classes for models and model managers
 - auto-discovery of models, model managers and CLI subcommands using entrypoints

WARNING
-------
This project is still in early stages and a lot of upgrades are yet to come.

Also, this module contains only the core logic of Quackamollie.
To install Quackamollie easily with model managers and models, we invite you to use the main project `quackamollie` which should be released this week (week 28 of 2024).

Finally, the documentation of this project is still laking a lot of things. Sorry for the inconvenience.


About Quackamollie
------------------
This project aims to provide a Telegram chat bot for personal use and running on local desktop.

What this project is:

 - a Telegram chat bot that you have to run on your own
 - a project aiming for personal use and/or use with friends or family
 - a project developed by currently one author and offered as an open source project by a non-profit association named the Forge of Absurd Ducks

What this project is NOT:

 - it is NOT a platform with servers aiming to provide service to a large number of users
 - it is NOT a commercial project

Roadmap
-------
We have a lot of features in mind for Quackamollie. We are currently releasing some projects which have already been prototyped
This projects implement:

 - easy installation of quackamollie's components (`quackamollie`)
 - model managers to serve models through Telegram (`quackamollie-ollama-model-manager`, `quackamollie-llama-index-model-manager`, `quackamollie-langchain-model-manager`)
 - models to answer requests through Telegram (`quackamollie-llama-index-simple-model`, `quackamollie-langchain-simple-model`)
 - some CLI tools to help developing (`quackamollie-devtools`)
 - a repository with CI/CD to auto-deploy quackamollie using docker-compose on local desktop using gitlab-runner (`quackamollie-ops`)
 - a repository with common CI/CDs for Quackamollie's projects (`quackamollie-workflows`)

These projects should be released very soon and then we will work on new functionalities such as:

 - new models (including RAG, pictures, etc.)
 - new tools for the models (including calendars, todolist, item lists for groceries, etc.)
 - new boilerplates to simplify creation of models, model tools, model managers and CLI commands
 - improving the `/settings` or other in-chat functionalities

Install
=======
- Install the application from sources

.. code-block:: bash

   make install
   # or
   pip install .

- Or install it from distribution

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install dist/quackamollie-core-0.1rc1.tar.gz

- Or install it from wheel

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install dist/quackamollie-core-0.1rc1.whl

- Or install it from PyPi repository

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install quackamollie-core  # latest
   # or
   pip install "quackamollie-core==0.1rc1"


Docker
======
- To build the application docker

.. code-block:: bash

   docker build --network=host -t quackamollie_core:0.1rc1 .

- The official Docker image of this project is available at: registry.gitlab.com/forge_of_absurd_ducks/quackamollie/lib/quackamollie_core

- You can pull the image of the current release:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker pull registry.gitlab.com/forge_of_absurd_ducks/quackamollie/lib/quackamollie_core:latest  # or dev
   # or
   docker pull registry.gitlab.com/forge_of_absurd_ducks/quackamollie/lib/quackamollie_core:0.1rc1


Docker-compose
==============
- To run database using docker-compose, you must first set environment variables:

 - `QUACKAMOLLIE_DB_HOST`: typically `0.0.0.0`
 - `QUACKAMOLLIE_DB_PORT`: typically `5432`
 - `QUACKAMOLLIE_DB_NAME`: typically `quackamollie`
 - `QUACKAMOLLIE_DB_USERNAME`: typically `quackamollie`
 - `QUACKAMOLLIE_DB_PASSWORD`: choose a strong admin password

- Then you can run:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker compose up
   # or to detach
   docker compose up -d

   # if you need to run it with sudo don't forget to add the -E option to pass the environment variables you've set
   sudo -E docker compose up

Database migration
==================
- Quackamollie provides a wrapper for the `alembic` command which initializes the database info the same way they are
  initialized at runtime. You can call `alembic` by using instead `quackamollie db alembic`. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   quackamollie db alembic --help

- We recommend you to use a configuration file using one of the examples provided in `config/examples/` and to change
  variables to match the ones used when calling `docker compose up`.

- To create schema revision if the database changes:

.. code-block:: bash

   quackamollie -c config/config.yml db alembic revision --autogenerate -m "A new change."

- You can then inspect the migration code (in python) with:

.. code-block:: bash

   cat migrations/versions/*

- Also inspect the resultant SQL code with:

.. code-block:: bash

   quackamollie -c config/config.yml db alembic upgrade --sql +1

- Finally, you can apply the migration with:

.. code-block:: bash

   quackamollie -c config/config.yml db alembic upgrade +1  # If you want to jump from 1
   quackamollie -c config/config.yml db alembic upgrade head  # If you want to go all the way to head

- If you now connect to ``pgcli``, you can test that the new table exists:

.. code-block:: bash

   make dbtools
   pgcli -U ${QUACKAMOLLIE_DB_USERNAME} -h ${QUACKAMOLLIE_DB_HOST} -p ${QUACKAMOLLIE_DB_PORT} ${QUACKAMOLLIE_DB_NAME}
   # and then on the pgcli console:
   \dt
   # and again on the pgcli console:
   SELECT * FROM users;

- alembic downgrade -1

.. code-block:: bash

   quackamollie -c config/config.yml db alembic downgrade -1

- You can also migrate using the `docker` image from our official docker registry.

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run --rm --name quackamollie-migration \
   --network host \
   --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/config/config.yml,target=/config/config.yml,readonly \
   registry.gitlab.com/forge_of_absurd_ducks/quackamollie/lib/quackamollie_core:0.1rc1 \
   -vvvv -c /config/config.yml db alembic upgrade head

   # if you need to run it with sudo don't forget to add the -E option to pass the environment variables you've set
   sudo -E docker run --rm --name quackamollie-migration \
   --network host \
   --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/config/config.yml,target=/config/config.yml,readonly \
   registry.gitlab.com/forge_of_absurd_ducks/quackamollie/lib/quackamollie_core:0.1rc1 \
   -vvvv -c /config/config.yml db alembic upgrade head

- To do the same using `docker-compose`, please refer to the `quackamollie` main repository.


Running the project
===================
Quackamollie-core provides a command tool line named `quackamollie`.
You can find examples of configuration files in the folder `config/examples`.

.. code-block:: bash

   quackamollie -vvvv -c config/config.yml serve

Pictures and demonstration videos will be included in the documentation in future releases.
