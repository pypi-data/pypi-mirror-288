Pre-commit will check for code formatting before completing the commit. If code is formatted by black, you will need to add the changes files to staged and re-try the commit.
Flake8 generally have to be handled manually.

To force a commit locally add the flag `--no-verify` as an option to `git commit` e.g. `git commit --no-verify -m "..."`. Github workflows should mirror local pre commit checks.
