    Placeholder function for running the ARIMA model to predict NBA player statistics.
    
    This function is intended to implement the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model
    for time series prediction. The model will be used to predict player statistics for every year
    for the first five years of their careers.

    TODO:
        - Implement the ARIMA model using a suitable library (e.g., statsmodels).
        - Prepare the data for time series analysis.
        - Train the model on historical data.
        - Use the model to make predictions for the specified time period.
