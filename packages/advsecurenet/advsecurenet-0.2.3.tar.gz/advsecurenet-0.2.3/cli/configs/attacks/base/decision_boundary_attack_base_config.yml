# Description: Base configuration file for the Decision Boundary attack
target_parameters: !include ../shared/attack_target_config.yml # Targeted attack configs
attack_parameters:
  initial_delta: 0.1 # The initial delta value to be used for the Decision Boundary attack. The higher the value, the more the perturbation
  initial_epsilon: 0.1 # The initial epsilon value to be used for the Decision Boundary attack. The higher the value, the more the perturbation
  max_delta_trials: 10 # The maximum number of trials to be used for the Decision Boundary attack during orthogonal search
  max_epsilon_trials: 10 # The maximum number of trials to be used for the Decision Boundary attack during forward search
  max_iterations: 1000 # The maximum number of iterations to be used for the Decision Boundary attack
  step_adapt: 0.9 # The step adapt value to be used to update the hyperparameters during the Decision Boundary attack
