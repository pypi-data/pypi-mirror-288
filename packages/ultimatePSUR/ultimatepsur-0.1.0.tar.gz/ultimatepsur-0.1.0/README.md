This structure and these files provide a basic implementation of the UltimatePSUR library. The `ProxyScraper` class handles scraping proxies from various sources. The `ProxyManager` class manages the proxy list, including updating and filtering working proxies. The `ProxyRotator` class provides methods for rotating proxies and using them to make requests.

The library includes basic logic for:
- Scraping proxies from multiple sources
- Filtering invalid proxies
- Checking if proxies are working
- Rotating through the proxy list
- Using proxies to make requests with retries
