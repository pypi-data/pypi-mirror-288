CPULimits:
  type: object
  description: The requested CPU to provision for a compute instance.
  additionalProperties: false
  properties:
    minimum:
      type: integer
      exclusiveMinimum: 0
      description: |
        The minimum CPUs to provision (in millicores). The compute instance will be guaranteed to receive at least this
        amount of CPU resources. If the system does not have enough CPU resources available the compute instance will
        fail to be provisioned.
    maximum:
      type: integer
      description: |
        The maximum CPUs to provision (in millicores). The compute instance will be allowed to scale to use more CPU
        resources up to this limit if available. Upon exceeding this limit the compute instance CPU will be throttled.
MemoryLimits:
  type: object
  description: The requested memory to provision for a compute instance.
  additionalProperties: false
  properties:
    minimum:
      type: integer
      exclusiveMinimum: 0
      description: |
        The minimum amount of memory to provision (in mebibytes). The compute instance will be guaranteed to receive at
        least this amount of memory. If the system does not have enough memory resources available the instance will
        fail to be provisioned.
    maximum:
      type: integer
      description: |
        The maximum amount of memory to provision (in mebibytes). The compute instance will be allowed to scale to use
        memory up to this limit if available.  Upon exceeding this limit the compute instance will use swap and may
        exit with Out-of-memory errors.
